Iâ€™m [Andre](https://andre-ye.github.io){:target="_blank"}, a junior at the University of Washington.
This website serves to host class notes at the University of Washington, as well as to host and share some of the work I've done in them. 
I'm pursuing a double major in Philosophy and Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. 
I tend to take a fairly wide range of classes, so I hope they are interesting and/or helpful to viewers.
This quarter I am taking:

- [PHIL 406](https://andre-ye.github.io/uni/docs/phil/phil-406), Philosophical Topics in Feminism
- [PHIL 455](https://andre-ye.github.io/uni/docs/phil/phil-455), Philosophy of Race
- [MATH 344](https://andre-ye.github.io/uni/docs/math/math-344), Honors Accelerated Advanced Calculus I
- [MATH 402](https://andre-ye.github.io/uni/docs/math/math-402), Introduction to Abstract Algebra I
