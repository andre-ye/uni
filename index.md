Iâ€™m Andre, and Iâ€™m on a mission to document my college experience. This website serves to host class notes at the University of Washington. Iâ€™m pursuing dual study in Computer Science and Philosophy.

**This website is still in the process of being transferred.** If you are looking for TS notes, please visit the link in the top right corner. Notes for UW classes will be uploaded soon. Note that this site works best with Chrome; using other browsers may expose bugs.

If you're also a student at the UW and are introduced in contributing your notes, reach out to me at `andreye@uw.edu` for possibilities of collaboration. I'm looking to convert this site from a personal project into a wide-ranging repository for college notes and content, if there are people willing to work with me to that end.
