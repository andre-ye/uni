Iâ€™m Andre, and Iâ€™m on a mission to document my college experience. This website serves to host class notes at the University of Washington. Iâ€™m pursuing dual study in Computer Science and Philosophy.

If you're also a student at the UW and are introduced in contributing your notes, reach out to me at `andreye@uw.edu` for possibilities of collaboration. I'm looking to convert this site from a personal project into a wide-ranging repository for college notes and content, if there are people willing to work with me to that end.
