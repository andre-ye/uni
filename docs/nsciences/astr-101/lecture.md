## Week 1 Monday -- Introduction to Course
- Read the syllabus
- Set up textbook
- The universe and stuff

## Week 1 Wednesday -- Patterns in the Sky
- Earth > solar system > milky way galaxy > local group > local supercluster (Laniakea) > the universe
- Anasazi Sun Dagger petroglphy, New Mexico
- Organizingt the Olympics -- getting people from many different places to come together
  - Solution : use states of celestial bodies as markers
- Astronomy is practiced in essentially every culture. You can't hide the sun, the moon, etc....: **celestial bodies are our universalities**
- Cultural history of astronomy occurs in constellations; stars stay together over time; the stars don't appear to move w.r.t. each other.
- Different interpretations of constellations: Orion re-interpreted as a hand by the Lakota
- Stars are in fact moving at very fast speeds; but their movements are hard to detect and are in fact unnoticeable.
- Various celestial bodies appear to rotate around the Earth in circular ways
- Sun rises in the east and sets in the west
- East -- where things are rising
- Longer patterns of motion and change -- phases of the moon; month -- moon; moon goes through noticeable changes in its resolution around the Earth
- Gets brighter from the right hand side and then disappears towards the left side.
- You can read by the light of the full moon; biological behavior adjusts
- Fill in tables on rise and set time of different moon quarters
- The motion of the sun changes location over time in clear ways. 
- Different constellations have different visibility at different times of the year due to the position of hte planet around the Sun
- Eclipses are about shadows
- Penumbral, partial, and total lunear eclipses
- Red moon -- the only light which hits it is light from the sun which is bent through the atmosphere and casts a red light on the moon.
- Most of the tie, the moon is either above or under the penumbra. The moon's shadow is small, the earth's shadow is large: explains the difference between lunar and solar eclipse frequency.
