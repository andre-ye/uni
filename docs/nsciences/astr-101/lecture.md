## Week 1 Monday -- Introduction to Course
- Read the syllabus
- Set up textbook
- The universe and stuff

---

## Week 1 Wednesday -- Patterns in the Sky
- Earth > solar system > milky way galaxy > local group > local supercluster (Laniakea) > the universe
- Anasazi Sun Dagger petroglphy, New Mexico
- Organizingt the Olympics -- getting people from many different places to come together
  - Solution : use states of celestial bodies as markers
- Astronomy is practiced in essentially every culture. You can't hide the sun, the moon, etc....: **celestial bodies are our universalities**
- Cultural history of astronomy occurs in constellations; stars stay together over time; the stars don't appear to move w.r.t. each other.
- Different interpretations of constellations: Orion re-interpreted as a hand by the Lakota
- Stars are in fact moving at very fast speeds; but their movements are hard to detect and are in fact unnoticeable.
- Various celestial bodies appear to rotate around the Earth in circular ways
- Sun rises in the east and sets in the west
- East -- where things are rising
- Longer patterns of motion and change -- phases of the moon; month -- moon; moon goes through noticeable changes in its resolution around the Earth
- Gets brighter from the right hand side and then disappears towards the left side.
- You can read by the light of the full moon; biological behavior adjusts
- Fill in tables on rise and set time of different moon quarters
- The motion of the sun changes location over time in clear ways. 
- Different constellations have different visibility at different times of the year due to the position of hte planet around the Sun
- Eclipses are about shadows
- Penumbral, partial, and total lunear eclipses
- Red moon -- the only light which hits it is light from the sun which is bent through the atmosphere and casts a red light on the moon.
- Most of the tie, the moon is either above or under the penumbra. The moon's shadow is small, the earth's shadow is large: explains the difference between lunar and solar eclipse frequency.

## Week 2 Monday --  A Universe in Motion
- Patterns we experience in the sky -- clusters and patterns of motion which clearly define important time units
- On most new moons, the moon's shadow doesn't hit the earth. You only get eclipses when everything is aligned well
- Ancient civilizations often documented sky objects
- Venus is unusual because it follows a different path htan other objects -- it wanders around
- Weird back-and-forth movement of Jupiter and Saturn
- 7 things which move in the sky -- 5 planets and the Sun and the  Non
- Babylonian cultures -- noticed stars were wandering around 'us', centered around the Earth. The planets 'care' about us
- Astrology -- deep influence on culture and history. We have lots of astronomical data becuase people held astrological significance for these celestial bodies
- Growing mythology in the Eastern Midterranan : a model of the universe in which the Earth sat inn the center with planets on giant wheels which spin around the Earth.
- Aristotelian geocentric model of the solar system
- Need to successively complicate a geocentrered theory: Ptolemization
- Why doubt the world?
  - Parllax
- The universe is spinning too -- the entire solar system moves a 1m km per hour.
- Our galaxy is being gravitationally pulled to other members of the local group, like M31.
- All motions moving under gravity.
- In every moment of your life, you are in a diffeent place -- you can't go home again
- Relativity

## Week 2 Wednesday -- Physics and Gravity
- Geocentric Ptolemaic model of the universe -- the Earth sits in the center of nesting shells
- Copernican model  -- a heliocentric revolution of the model (late 1500s, 1540s in Northern Europe)
- The idea of the earth moving aroud the sun is in fact an ancient idea
- If the blue dot is the earth, nearby stars compared to more distant stars should appear to move back and forth, taking one year to go around. This really does happen -- parallactic motion -- but it is too small to see this with the naked eye.
- The closest star to the Earth beyond the sun -- Alpha Centauri -- really does move back and forth, but about the width of a human hair at an arm's width.
- Many people thought this was the issue which held back tot he heliocentric idea.
- However most people thought that if the Earth was moving wouldn't we feel a big wind blowing all the time -- why would we not fall off of the Earth?
- Ptolemy -- the Earth must be the center of the universe -- if the Earth is not at its center, then it must be in motion. It is therefore obvious that the Earth is not in motion.
- Lots of old ideas intellectually assaulted in the 1500s -- new fields of people in science
- Galileo Galilei -- refute basic tenets of Aristotelian physics.
  - Ambituous
  - Wanted to do big things
- Aristotle -- things want to be at rest. Galileo shows that objects do not come to rest because they want to but because there are frictional forces.
  - A pacification / de-agenting of objectss
  - Newton plagiarizes this observation in his first law
- Most of Galileo's contributions come with the users of the telescope
- The moon looks like the Earth in a particular kind of way
- In a few weeks Galileo was able to conclude that moons orbited Jupiter
- When Jupiter was moving through the sky, the moons kept up -- they weren't left behind, they just kept on moving in this way
- The view of Venus from Earth in the Ptolemaic system is insufficient. Venus at least orbit the sun.
- Johannes Kepler -- 1596, published a defense of Copernicus' ideas. Worked to defend the heliocentric model.
- Uses the planetary observations of Tycho Brahe to develop laws of planetary motion -- uses ellipses instead of circles to describe how planets orbit the Sun.
  - Letting go of the circles
- Kepler's second law: planets sweep out equal areas in equal times -- precise description of changing rate at which planets move in their orbits
- Kepler's 3rd law -- extends the second law: if you're always closer to the Sun, you'll move faster than a farther planet -- extended version
- Kepler was able to produce the most accurate predictions of planetary motions ever -- noticeably more than those of the Ptolemaic model or the original Copernican model.
- Between 1550 and 1650, most astronomers shifted from believing the geocentric model to the heliocentric model.
- There is no such thing as stillness -- the death of staticity -- there is only motion -- all we do is move, move through time and space
- There are no 'objective' coordinates
- Why is this happening? The Earth is moving around the sun, but why?
- Keppler tried: maybe the sun is a big magnet (magnetism recently discovered) pulling the Earth around the sun
- Isaac Newton -- formulated many of the ideas of motion and mass which woudl lead to gravity
- Change in direction is an acceleration -- you have to do something to change direction.
- Newton's three laws of motion
  - #2: force is mass times acceleration
  - #3: for any force there is alwyas an equal and opposite reaction force
- The moon is accelerating because it's changing direction all the time -- this means that there must be some unseen forth operating on the Earth
  - This also means by law #3 that the moon and all objects act a force out
- The smae force applies to apples on Earth and the moon around the Earth.
- The moon is always falling around the Earth
- Newton utterly breaks the old Aristotelian system, changes how we think about the universe. Before Newton, we could not study the moon -- the idea that you can understand the moon by studying things carefully on the Earth you can make conclusions about things which you cannot directlye xperience: it opens up the universe to us for human understanding.
  - Interesting statements about universality.
- Force between two stars depends on their mass: what is the ratio of the masses betweent them? This gives you the ratio of their strength, and that's all you need to know. 
- Stars barely move because they're so much smaller than the planet. Rotation around center of mass.
- Mass / volume = density
- Water has a density of 1 gm / cm$$^3$$
- People have approximately a density of 1 gram / cube centimer
- We can measure mass and radii of large bodies, and therefore their denities, from which we can guess what materials they are made of
