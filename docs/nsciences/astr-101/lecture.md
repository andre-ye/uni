## Week 1 Monday -- Introduction to Course
- Read the syllabus
- Set up textbook
- The universe and stuff

---

## Week 1 Wednesday -- Patterns in the Sky
- Earth > solar system > milky way galaxy > local group > local supercluster (Laniakea) > the universe
- Anasazi Sun Dagger petroglphy, New Mexico
- Organizingt the Olympics -- getting people from many different places to come together
  - Solution : use states of celestial bodies as markers
- Astronomy is practiced in essentially every culture. You can't hide the sun, the moon, etc....: **celestial bodies are our universalities**
- Cultural history of astronomy occurs in constellations; stars stay together over time; the stars don't appear to move w.r.t. each other.
- Different interpretations of constellations: Orion re-interpreted as a hand by the Lakota
- Stars are in fact moving at very fast speeds; but their movements are hard to detect and are in fact unnoticeable.
- Various celestial bodies appear to rotate around the Earth in circular ways
- Sun rises in the east and sets in the west
- East -- where things are rising
- Longer patterns of motion and change -- phases of the moon; month -- moon; moon goes through noticeable changes in its resolution around the Earth
- Gets brighter from the right hand side and then disappears towards the left side.
- You can read by the light of the full moon; biological behavior adjusts
- Fill in tables on rise and set time of different moon quarters
- The motion of the sun changes location over time in clear ways. 
- Different constellations have different visibility at different times of the year due to the position of hte planet around the Sun
- Eclipses are about shadows
- Penumbral, partial, and total lunear eclipses
- Red moon -- the only light which hits it is light from the sun which is bent through the atmosphere and casts a red light on the moon.
- Most of the tie, the moon is either above or under the penumbra. The moon's shadow is small, the earth's shadow is large: explains the difference between lunar and solar eclipse frequency. 

---

## Week 2 Monday --  A Universe in Motion
- Patterns we experience in the sky -- clusters and patterns of motion which clearly define important time units
- On most new moons, the moon's shadow doesn't hit the earth. You only get eclipses when everything is aligned well
- Ancient civilizations often documented sky objects
- Venus is unusual because it follows a different path htan other objects -- it wanders around
- Weird back-and-forth movement of Jupiter and Saturn
- 7 things which move in the sky -- 5 planets and the Sun and the  Non
- Babylonian cultures -- noticed stars were wandering around 'us', centered around the Earth. The planets 'care' about us
- Astrology -- deep influence on culture and history. We have lots of astronomical data becuase people held astrological significance for these celestial bodies
- Growing mythology in the Eastern Midterranan : a model of the universe in which the Earth sat inn the center with planets on giant wheels which spin around the Earth.
- Aristotelian geocentric model of the solar system
- Need to successively complicate a geocentrered theory: Ptolemization
- Why doubt the world?
  - Parllax
- The universe is spinning too -- the entire solar system moves a 1m km per hour.
- Our galaxy is being gravitationally pulled to other members of the local group, like M31.
- All motions moving under gravity.
- In every moment of your life, you are in a diffeent place -- you can't go home again
- Relativity

---

## Week 2 Wednesday -- Physics and Gravity
- Geocentric Ptolemaic model of the universe -- the Earth sits in the center of nesting shells
- Copernican model  -- a heliocentric revolution of the model (late 1500s, 1540s in Northern Europe)
- The idea of the earth moving aroud the sun is in fact an ancient idea
- If the blue dot is the earth, nearby stars compared to more distant stars should appear to move back and forth, taking one year to go around. This really does happen -- parallactic motion -- but it is too small to see this with the naked eye.
- The closest star to the Earth beyond the sun -- Alpha Centauri -- really does move back and forth, but about the width of a human hair at an arm's width.
- Many people thought this was the issue which held back tot he heliocentric idea.
- However most people thought that if the Earth was moving wouldn't we feel a big wind blowing all the time -- why would we not fall off of the Earth?
- Ptolemy -- the Earth must be the center of the universe -- if the Earth is not at its center, then it must be in motion. It is therefore obvious that the Earth is not in motion.
- Lots of old ideas intellectually assaulted in the 1500s -- new fields of people in science
- Galileo Galilei -- refute basic tenets of Aristotelian physics.
  - Ambituous
  - Wanted to do big things
- Aristotle -- things want to be at rest. Galileo shows that objects do not come to rest because they want to but because there are frictional forces.
  - A pacification / de-agenting of objectss
  - Newton plagiarizes this observation in his first law
- Most of Galileo's contributions come with the users of the telescope
- The moon looks like the Earth in a particular kind of way
- In a few weeks Galileo was able to conclude that moons orbited Jupiter
- When Jupiter was moving through the sky, the moons kept up -- they weren't left behind, they just kept on moving in this way
- The view of Venus from Earth in the Ptolemaic system is insufficient. Venus at least orbit the sun.
- Johannes Kepler -- 1596, published a defense of Copernicus' ideas. Worked to defend the heliocentric model.
- Uses the planetary observations of Tycho Brahe to develop laws of planetary motion -- uses ellipses instead of circles to describe how planets orbit the Sun.
  - Letting go of the circles
- Kepler's second law: planets sweep out equal areas in equal times -- precise description of changing rate at which planets move in their orbits
- Kepler's 3rd law -- extends the second law: if you're always closer to the Sun, you'll move faster than a farther planet -- extended version
- Kepler was able to produce the most accurate predictions of planetary motions ever -- noticeably more than those of the Ptolemaic model or the original Copernican model.
- Between 1550 and 1650, most astronomers shifted from believing the geocentric model to the heliocentric model.
- There is no such thing as stillness -- the death of staticity -- there is only motion -- all we do is move, move through time and space
- There are no 'objective' coordinates
- Why is this happening? The Earth is moving around the sun, but why?
- Keppler tried: maybe the sun is a big magnet (magnetism recently discovered) pulling the Earth around the sun
- Isaac Newton -- formulated many of the ideas of motion and mass which woudl lead to gravity
- Change in direction is an acceleration -- you have to do something to change direction.
- Newton's three laws of motion
  - #2: force is mass times acceleration
  - #3: for any force there is alwyas an equal and opposite reaction force
- The moon is accelerating because it's changing direction all the time -- this means that there must be some unseen forth operating on the Earth
  - This also means by law #3 that the moon and all objects act a force out
- The smae force applies to apples on Earth and the moon around the Earth.
- The moon is always falling around the Earth
- Newton utterly breaks the old Aristotelian system, changes how we think about the universe. Before Newton, we could not study the moon -- the idea that you can understand the moon by studying things carefully on the Earth you can make conclusions about things which you cannot directlye xperience: it opens up the universe to us for human understanding.
  - Interesting statements about universality.
- Force between two stars depends on their mass: what is the ratio of the masses betweent them? This gives you the ratio of their strength, and that's all you need to know. 
- Stars barely move because they're so much smaller than the planet. Rotation around center of mass.
- Mass / volume = density
- Water has a density of 1 gm / cm$$^3$$
- People have approximately a density of 1 gram / cube centimer
- We can measure mass and radii of large bodies, and therefore their denities, from which we can guess what materials they are made of

## Week 3 Monday -- Terrestrial and Jovian Planets
- Materializing the world -- a new universality
- Patterns in planets -- 'the big worlds'
- Why is the universe so different? A large range of compositions
- All the planets lie in the same plane
- Same direction of rotation (almost)
  - Venus rotates in the other direction
  - Uranus rotates on its side; a day is longer than a year
- Solar nebula model: like we see nebula in space, some of which are the sites of star formations
  - Nebula -- a formation of dust and gas in place
  - Solar nebula is a good idea
- Orion constellation
- Forming stars are surrounded by disks of gas and dust 
- HL Tau: a disk formed around it with some gaps, where the mateiral is coalescing to form gaseous planets
- You have a slowly spinning interstellar cloud (nebula) which is collapsing; it inevitably forms a dik. 
- Material falls in along the axis of rotation -- rotation retards collapse in the plane perpendicular to the axis.
- Major difference between the terrestrial planets and the jovial planets -- their masses are much higher than the terrestrial ones 
- These worlds are not made of rock and metal -- mainly hydrogen, helium, hydrogen compounds
- We have visited all the planets at least once -- 50 years to take a photo fo all the planets
- Terrestrial planets are mainy rock and metal 
- The Earth is mostly rock -- the atmospheres are very thin. Mercury and the moon basically don't have forces which create interesting erosion on Earth and Mars
- Moon and Mercury are littered with craters, and there is noe rosion or plate tectonics to renew the surface
- Atmospheres are merely thin skins on solid, rocky surfaces
- The Jovian planets are basically all atmosphere -- no surface
- It is believed that there is a 'surface', 'core' of highly pressurized gases
- Very different compositions
- Why are the planets like this?
- In the conditions of the solar nebula, we have accretion -- individual dust grains which begin to build up in size. Planetismals then something large enough to be round with gravity
- Kep difference is where it forms. The Sun in the middle -- it is very hot near to the sun, and very cold farther from it; so there ar edifferent choices for material. You have metal and rock which can be high solids near the sun. (Rocks and metals are actually quite rare galatically). Only choices are rocks and metal. But then you can have water ice; farther, you get methane ice, nitrogen, etc.
- Protoplanets in the solar system can grow larger for gravity to begin attracting hydrogen and helim gas (most abundant materials in the solar nebular). Worlds  go from super-sized terrestrial planets to gas giants
- Gas capture phase -- formed farther from the Sun; there is ice needed, which helps you to get large quickly and to collect large atmospheres. Terrestrial planets: can only form from rock and metal.
- Jovian planets collected many moons -- brojught a lot of solid material 
- Galileo discovered Jupiter's Galilean moons -- objects rotate around Jupiter
- Io has fascinating geography: one of the oly bodies in the solar system which has active volcanoes. Most geologically active system; Io has a lot of sulfur; molten sulfur lakes on Io
- Tidal heating
- Europa --  also has tidal heating, but not to the extent of sulfur volcanoes; enough to keep it warm. Europe also has a lot of ice. Europa is possibly covered in ice flotating on top of water.
- Titan -- it looks featureless, but bc it has a very thick atmosphere. However we landed on it. We see lakes of methane and rocks (made of ice). 

---

## Week 3 Wednesday -- Asteroids and Comets
- Addition of ices in the outer solar system means that worlds which start out as small amount of rock grow very quickly that they develop gravity in the solar nebula and begin to clear out an area of the nebula by sucking out gas
- Titan -- Saturn's planet, very large moon
- Every jovian planet has a ring system
- Saturn has obvious rings  which have been known for a long time; Galileo observed something was off; Christiaan Huygens observes Saturn through a Saturn-year and sees with the different profiles that it has a ring at a tilt; sometimes e see it at an angle or edge-on.
- Saturn's rings have small moons
  - F-ring: small shepherd moons in the rings help keep bands in check -- to keep them in a flat structure, carving out gaps in them
- Rings are very thin -- less than a few hundred meters, which is very very narrow -- partly because these moons keep things in line
- Rings are made of many tiny ice particles which orbit Saturn
- Ring particles can easily become charged and interact with Saturn's magnetic field; therefore it begins to rain down on Saturn
- Rings are not going to last more than a million years -- either we're very lucky or there's new material going into the rings.
  - Rings are transient, which implies a short lifetime -- what happened here to create these rings?
- All Jovian planets have ring systems -- it's just that Saturn has very well defined rings.
- Jovian planets have collected many moons; if rings are created by moons coliding and creating debris, then that makes sense
- Saturn's large rings may come from a particularly large impact, but the origin isn't entirely clear
- Jupiter gravitationally dominates a lot of the solar system
  - Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 crashes into Jupiter, producing dozens of impact sites -- massive explosions of energy
- 40 meter object explodes in the atmosphere destroyed over 2000 sq km of forest.
- Dinosaurs almost certainly went extinct because of an impact in the Gulf of Mexico -- 
- Most impacts are small
- Meteriorites hit the Earth ever few minutes and prroduce shooting stars
- Every few years, we will eencounter a ad '
- Any chunk of thing which falls into the atmosphere is a mteor; most likely degree
- Most meteors are made of bits of astreorids and comets
- Jupiter has its own colllection of asteoirds
  - Just approaching Jupiter forced Shoe-maker Levy 9 to break apart -- shear forces getting to Jupiter
- Comets are full of volaties (ices), frostline where ice sublimates -- particles get pushed apart and form comets of their own. The tail isn't streaking through space and stuff is falling behind -- the tail is being carried away by the sun's win; particles are now in a different orbit than the original comet
- Churyumov-Gerasimenko -- you can jets of material evaporating from its surface and steaming away into space
  - Rosetta mission -- has a very weak and constructed shape
  - What do we do if one of these come by?
- Asteroids are generally made more of rock and iron, but are loosely held together by gravity -- well modeled as bubble piles. You're throwing small stuff together; stuck for now but not for the future
- Earth's atmosphere is fairly thin -- it won't protect from large bodies
- Few comets ever enter the inner solar system and are unlikely to strike Earth; most are found in the Kuiper belt beyond Neptune
- Kuiper belt -- area of many small rocky icy bodies which have been put out by the Jovian planets -- leftover planet making material
- Oort cloud -- far away from the solar system is a lot of icy bodies thrown in a huge area with a spherical distribution; theorized to exist because comets have a lifetime; they get small everyt ime they come by the sun but we stilll see them; where are they coming from? Idea -- very large cloud of material which holds material getting thrown into the solar system.
  - Things which are disc shaped are disc shaped because they come from the solar nebula
  - In close encounters getting thrown over th eplace with the jovian planets, we get spherical shapes; most of the solar system has been cleared out
- Most asteroids are in the asteorid belt, but they are not that closely packed.
  - One of the few places in the solar system where you can throw in a rock and it can not get thrown around byt eh planets. 
- Near-Earth Objects -- orbits cross with the orbit of Earth at some point.
- Most 1km+ asteroids have been discovered.

## Week 4 Monday -- Chaos and Contingency in Planetary Systems
- Rings are produced by asteroids and comets running into the moons of large Jovian planets -- hits one of the moons and that kicks up enough dust to form a ring / contribute to a ring.
- Comets reveal chaos in interactions with Jovian worlds.
- Short-period comets tend to be prograde; long-period comets have no clear plane or preferred direction of rotation -- long-period orbits show randomness clearly.
- Comets are out there in a random spherical distribution because they are the comets which missed Jupiter and the moons -- which almost ran into Saturn but different, and so their orbits got jacked off, now they get fucked far into the solar system due to contingent chaotic events.
- Chaos and contingency -- a comet which gets close to Jupiter -- become a ring; if you miss, out into the Oort cloud.
- The Oort cloud is pretty much it for the solar syestem
- We need to look at other planetary systems to consider planets around other stars -- can the model of solar system explainw ahtwe see in other planetary systems?
- Stars like the sun are much brighter than planets.
- Planets are a billion times dimmer than stars are -- so planets are very hard to see bc they are so small and dim
- We don't find planets by finding planets: we find planets around stars by looking at the star -- let the star reveal the presence of a planet -- the center of mass of the sun changes a little bit -- wobbles. 
- 1995, first exoplanet discovered -- 51 Pegasi, routinely moves towards us, has a 4-day orbitla period around its parent star
- Gravity -- the planet is pulling on the star, pulling the Sun. You learn there is a planet and its gravitational pull, then its mass. We can calculate mass given the orbital speed. 
- Transit method -- if a planet orbiting another star passes often between us and the star, then the star temporarily dim for us. This has to happen repeatedly before we can establish significance.
- Not mass, but size (diameter) given by transit method
- Transit methois imortat []
- Large telescopes
- Most plaenete do have solar systems -- thea verage number of plaents per straris more than 1 -- most stars
- Planetary systems are very complex and basically form around all stars
- Our model makes sense wutg terrerp'0 
- We can start with el= == a freckly. 
- Bizarre characteristic os fextrasolar planets
  - Semi-major axis by eccentricity: very low eccentricity in our solar system. 
  - Jovian-type planets orbiting closer to their star than the Earth does -- does not seem to line up with solar nebula theory
  - "Hot Jupiters" orbiting other stars -- as close as 0.03 AU to their stars, orbits as short as 1.2 Earth days
  - Why? Not that planets formed close tot hose stars, but they formed far away from the stars by the solar nebula model and then they started moving around. Planets clear out gaps in the solar nebula; but there's still material; if there is more material on one side, it begins moving inwards over time towards the gravitational pull of the side material as it clears out material
  - Gravitational forces can create all sorts of chaos, including migration, mergers, and highly eccentric mergers
- If a body just misses a body, its orbit can change significantly
- We believe that Jupiter and Saturn moved inwards and then things shift backwards again -- this kind of moving around happens in our solar system in subtle and dramatic ways
- Earth moon formation -- formed that something hit us -- if it missed us, no moon: the absolute contingency of the universe
- Philosophically: but what is contingency, really?
- Venus may have been hit so far it is spinning backwards; Uranus tilts over by 98 degrees
- It takes studying other planets to understand the way our solar system is laid out is fairly arbitrary adn contingent -- it's almost random chance.  There are simple rules -- but once you start putting it together, what you get depends a lot on what happened.

## Week 4 Wednesday -- Measuring and INterpreting Light
- Moving into the second act (first act -- here on Earth), leaving our homes behind
- We can undrstand distant objects,b ut we just need to know more about light
- We know a lot more aobut how light works
- Light -- a way that energy propgates around the universe 
- Wavelength
- Frequency: how many waves pass per unit of time
- No matter its wavelength or frequency, all light moves through the universe at the smae speed.
- However becuase red has a lower frequency than blue, more blue waves move in space than red waves in any period of time or space
- Light shakes electric and magnetic fields -- hsorter wavelengths pack a lot more punch
- Your eyes are sensitive to a very small range of wavelengths -- if the energy is too low or large your eye cells aren't being activated.
- X-rays (ultraviolet): higher frequency than visible spectrum; radio waves, microwave radiation (infrared): lower frequency than visible spectrum
  - Infrared waves can be very long -- meters or km long.
  - Ultraviolet -- slightly higher energies than visible spectrum
  - Gamma rays -- even higher frequency
- Light which I see is reflected light -- dyes reflect certain colors and not others
- But I am also making light -- I have a certain temperature hotter than the room around me, and I am producing infrared light, which we think of as heat, but it is really radiation 
- Light interacts with different things in very different ways
- Light is based on temperature: molecules banging into each other, producing radiation, which leaves my body. What sort of glow you make depends on how much activity there is, and therefore how much energy they produce
- There is a form of radiation that all things which are not transparent make which depend on their temperature
- Smooth and continuous without break: continuous radiation
- Hotter objects produce more light per area unit at all wave lengths, so the peak of hotter objects move to bluer colors at higher temperature
- THings look good becasue they;re produing more blue than not blue
- Electrons in any atom respond in a predicable way to particular energies
- Every elment prouced a 'barcode' when exposed to light
- Bombining continuous spectrum and birght light p specitrum -- e=we  that deelat proccesssssnt
- Inteferes with motion: Doppler Shifrt / redshit -- sounds waves are pressure waves -- shacking air in the room -- shaky air shakes the ones in y
  - Higher patch with higher frequency and shorter wavelength
  - Lower frequency and wavelength
- Reflecting telescope -- uses curvmrirros to eing ight to Earth; 1960s. Curr position matter
- We use reflecting instead of refracting telescopes by size -- you can make mirrors much much larger than you can make lenses -- we can build 30-meter telescopes or more -- a mirror just just some shiny stuff sitting at the bottom, much easier to engineer.
- Why does size matter when it comes to telescopes? Currently planning a 100-m telescope. TWo reasons you need a big teloscope:
  - A telescope is a bucket which collects light: the bigger your telescope mirror/lens, the more light passes through it every second, so you can see fainter things. *Fainter* - not farther, but fainter. Sometimes things are faint because they're far, but they can be faint because they're small and dark. 
  - Size of the telescope sets the level of detail you can see in your focused image. A big telescope improves the angular resolution of images -- more detail.  also called angular separation -- smallest possible angle you can detect with your telescope system
- For most time we've used the human eye -- which is great. But the human eye 'erases' every 0.03 seconds or so -- if we want to see something faint, it has to be bright enough to make an impression in .03 seconds, which restricts you 
- Mid-1800s, invention of photography: astronomy becomes astrophysics. You can take a picture of what is happening.
