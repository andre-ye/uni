## Chapter 1: Science and the Universe -- A Brief Tour

### 1.1: The Nature of Astronomy
- Astronomy -- obejcts which lie beyond Earth
- Humanity's attempt to formulate a *history of the universe*

### 1.2: The Nature of Science
- Science is a method through which we acquire knowledge
- Models as ideal approximations of nature
- Note -- astronomy has an intimate relationship with models
- Hypothesis must be testable with experimentation
- Astronomy as an observational and a historical science. This is interesting epistemically.
- Science is self-correcting. (is it?)

### 1.3: The Laws of Nature
- Rules by which nature plays
- Universal laws held by induction
- Imposition of laws across neighborhoods for consistency.
- General relativity and black holes
- The limitations of language necessitates mathematics

### 1.4: Numbers in Astronomy
- Scientific notation
- Light year -- the distance light travels in one year. Fastest speed in the universe.

### 1.5: Consequences of Light Travel Time
- Information in the universe almost exclusively comes to us in forms of light.
- The speed of light is the limit on how quickly we can learn about the universe.
- Now is when light reaches us on earth.
- The old age of cosmic light allows us to better trace a cosmic history.

### 1.6: A Tour of the Universe
- Moon -- Earth's satellite. 
- Light takes 1.3 seconds to travel from the moon to the earth.
- Distance between the earth and the sun is an astronomical unit (AU).
- Earth is one of eight planets which go around the sun.
- The Sun is a local star
- Galaxy -- Milky Way Galaxy -- a giant disk with a small ball
- The space between stars is not completely empty, it has some gas and some small particles
- Interstellar material is very sparse
- Dust in space can block up light of distant stars
- Dark matter -- its gravity is exerted on stars, but we do not know what it is made of.
- Some stars are involved in double or triple systems
- No star lasts forever; eventually all stars run out of fuel.

### 1.7: The Universe on the Large Scale
- The universe is made up of a large number of galaxies.
- Universe: everything accessible to our observations
- Galaxies -- island universes, groups of stars in intergalactic space
- Local group -- a cluster of about 50 galaxies
- Galaxies occur mostly in clusters, large and small
- Superclusters -- Virgo Supercluster, local group is part of this
- Quasars -- centers of galaxies. These are the brightest things we can see, including close to the big bang explosion which begins time.

### 1.8: The Universe of the Very Small
- The Galaxy is mostly empty space
- One atom per cubic centimeter in interstellar Galaxy gas
- Dense places like the human body are very rare in the universe
- Cosmically abundant elements: hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen

## Chapter 2: Observing the Sky -- The Birth of Astronomy
### 2.1: The Sky Above
- Geocentric view: humans as the central focus of the cosmos. 
- One of the great monuments of our intellectual history is to overthrow geocentrism.
- Zenith -- point directly above you; horizon -- dome meets surface of Earth
- Celestial sphere, Greeks
- North and south celestial pole
- The sun changes position
- The Sun takes a ecliptic path
- Fixed and wandering stars
- Planets -- wandering stars; planet means wanderer in ancient Greek
- Constellations: geometric patterns formed by groupings of stars
- Telescopes reveal millions of stars which are too small for the eye to see
- Constellation refers to 88 sectors of the sky

### 2.2: Ancient Astronomy
- Ancient astronomers were able to grasp the length of a year
- Cosmology: our concept of the basics tructure and origin of the cosmos
- Eastern Mediterraneans knew Earth was round; Pythagoras may have pioneered round earthers
- Parallax: the apparent shift in the direction of an object as a result of the motion of the observer
- Stellar parallax: shift in the apparent direction of a star due to Earth's orbital motion. Stars however did not seem to shift in spring vs in fall, when Earth is on the opposite side of the sun.

> This meant either that Earth was not moving or that the stars had to be so tremendously far away that the parallax shift was immeasurably small. A cosmos of such enormous extent required a leap of imagination that most ancient philosophers were not prepared to make, so they retreated to the safety of the Earth-centered view, which would dominate Western thinking for nearly two millennia.

- Eratosthenes: measuring a single angle in one region allowed for determining the size of th Earth.
- Hipparchus: measured positions of objects in the sky and provided the coordinates for understanding this world. The position in the sky over the north pole changed over the previous 1.5 century. Earth must be doing the wobbling. **Precession**: the direction in which Earth's axis points
- Ptolemy: geometric representation of the solar system which predicted the position oft he planets.
- Epicycle: each planet revolves in a local circle as well as in a broader circle. However it was in fact that the planets travelled in ellipses; circles do not work.
- Will the revolution be Copernican or a Ptolemization? -- a Ptolemization requires increasing complex analyse sand mechanisms to make it work.

### 2.3: Astrology and Astronomy
- Planets and stars as symbols of gods and the supernatural, the metaphysical (technology is the making of the metaphysical into the physical)
- Astrology begins in Babylon
- Natal astrology -- Ptolemy, the *Tetrabiblos*. An ancient religion of shorts
- Horoscopes -- mappings of birth to the position of stars in the sky
- Astrologists posit unknown forces exerted by planets -- epistemic inaccess
- Why do we identify with horoscopes? Maybe they are true in the more philosophical sense, that we feel the need to identify a particularity of ourselves, and the truth of the horoscope -- and its sadness -- is that this particularity is totally arbitrary. So maybe we should think about how even if we turn away from astrological horoscopes, we turn towards other horoscopes -- my college major, my interests, my quirkiness, etc.

### 2.4: The Birth of Modern Astronomy
- Many names for stars come from Arabic
- Copernicus -- new Sun-centered, heliocentric model of the solar system
- If Earthw were moving, we would feel this motion -- objection to Copernian revolution. 
- Copernicus could not prove the Earth revolves around the Sun, but appealed to the lack of beauty in Ptolemaic cosmology.
- Galileo: pioneered many modern principles of science
  - Greatest contributions were to mechanics
  - Acceleration 
  - Pioneered telescope
  - Interesting question -- what is the believability of microscopes? What does it mean to see something as if you had a 'small eye'?
- Galileo confirmed the Copernican hypothesis
- The Roman Catholic Church condmened Galileo.
- Modernity: nature is rational and ultimately knowable through experimetns and observations

## Chapter 3: Orbits and Gravity
### 3.1: The Laws of Planetary Motion
- Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler
- Brahe: recorded the loction of the sun, moon, and the planets
- Kepler helped understand the planetary data; developed Kepler's three laws
- Orbit: path of an object through space. Orbits are ellipses
- Major axis (widest) and semimajor axis
- Eccentricity: ratio of distance between foci to the length of the major axis
- First law: orbits of all planets are ellipses -- no need to move things in circles.
- Second law: planets speed up when they come closer to the sun and slow down when they get away. The area swept out in space over time along the orbit relative to the sun is always equal in equal intervals of time.
- Third law: a planet's orbital period squared is proportional to the semimajor axis of its orbit cubed
  - A planet's semimajor axis is equal to its average distance from the sun
  - Orbital period: time it takes for a planet to travel once around the sun
  - When the orbital period is measured in years and the semimajor axis in AUs, $$P^2 = a^3$$
  
### 3.2: Newton's Great Synthesis
- Science first called natural philosophy
- Newton's first law: an object will continue to be in a state of rest or move at a constant speed in a straight line without external influence
  - Conservation of momentum
  - Momentum: mass times velocity
- Newton's second law: the change of motion of a body is proportional to and in the direction of the force acting on it
  - A force is required to change speed and/or direction
- Newton's third law: for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction
  - Acceleration of a body is proportional to the force being applied to it. 
  - Generalization of the first law
  - Lets us define mass
  - In a system isolated from outside influences, total momentum of objects should remain constant (law 1)
  - Change in momentum *has to be balanced* by another change which is equal and opposite
  - There is always a pair of forces; if a force is exerted on an object, the object exerts another equal and opposite force.
  - What really is force as formalized?
- Mass -- measure of material in an object
- Volume -- amount of physical space occupied
- Density -- mass per volume
- Angular momentum: measure of rotation of a body revolving around a fixed point
- Kepler's second law: conservation of anglar momentum

### 3.3: Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation
- Newton: gravity causes planets to move in ellipses, rather than straight lines (as per the first law)
- Pre-Newton: gravity applies only to Earth.
- Earth's gravity can extend as far as the moon and curve the path to a straight line.
- Universal attraction among all bodies everywhere in space
- Newton invented calculus to deal with problems in universal attraction
- Magnitude of the force of gravity must decrease with increasing distance between the sun and the planet in proportion to the inverse square of their separation
- Gravity gives us our sense of weight
- Why does the moon not fall in? Why in general would bodies orbit and not spiral out or in? It seems like equilibrium is fragile
- Gravity is built into the concept of mass: wherever there is mass, there is attraction.
- What constitutes a 'body'? Because if you break it down all it really is is atoms together, right? Is it density? How are we defining an object? Isn't that kind of a subjective imposition?
- Gravity can never become zero, even though it can become infinitely weaker
- Astronauts feel weightless because they are falling: you accelerate at the same rate as everything around you, and so you experience no additional forces. So you continue to fall through, but not towards earth but around it.
- Orbital motion and mass: factoring in masses shows us that the orbital period squared times the sum of the two bodies' masses equals the semimajor axis cubed.

### 3.4: Orbits in the Solar System
- Place where planet is closest to Sun: perihelion
  - Farthest away: aphelion
  - Orbiting Earth: perigee, apogee
- All planets have low-eccentric orbits except for Mercury (0.21)
- Comets have larger orbit sizes and eccentiricites than asteroids

### 3.5: Motions of Satellites and Spacecraft
- The behavior of an artificial satellite is the same as that of natural satellites
- Circular satellite velocity -- speed needed to fall around Earth
- Escape speed: speed needed to move away from Earth forever
- Spacecraft sometimes use gravity to direct spacecraft to another target, like 'swingbys'.

### 3.6: Gravity with More Than Two Bodies
- All planets exert gravity on themselves as well. 
- Discovery of Neptune
- Uranus -- originally recorded as a star. Herschel discovers that some planets are too dim to be unaided but are visible with a telescope.
- Uranus does not move in an orbit predicted by Newtonian theory: another planet is influencing its trajectory, Neptune. 
- Proved the generality of Newton's laws.

## Chapter 4: Earth, Moon, and Sky

### 4.1: Earth and Sky
- Great circle -- any circle whose center is at the center of the sphere
- Meidian
- Longitude of the prime meridian is 0 degrees; it passes through Greenwich, England.
- Declination and right ascension: make use of a fictitious celestial sphere.
- Why does the Earth turn? Jean Foucault and the pendulum

### 4.2: The Seasons
- There are significant variations in heat received from the Sun throughout the year
- Seasons: different amount of sunlight.
- Seasons are not the result of changing distance between the earth and the sun. Seasons are actually caused by the 23.5 degree tilt of the Earth's axis.
- Arctic and Antarctic circles -- the place where sun can hit all day long
- Hottest months are July and August because the Sun progressively heats it up even after the summer solstice

### 4.3: Keeping Time
- Solar day: rotation period of Earth w.r.t. the Sun
- Sidereal day: defined in terms of rotation period of Earth w.r.t. stars
- **Why can't we just measure how much Earth rotates 'on its own'? **
- Apparent solar time: actual position of the Sun in the sky, given by sundials. 
- Mean solar time: average value of the solar day over the course of the year. 24 hours
- Standardization of time zones: noon is different for everyone
- Travelers reset watches only when time change accumulates to a full hour.
- New time zone ever 15 degrees longitude. 
- International Date Line: set at 180 degree meridian. By convention the date of the calendar is changed.

> To maintain our planet on a rational system of timekeeping, we simply must accept that the date will differ in different cities at the same time.

- What is time, really? Because I can't observe something happening in Japan at the same time. What is the rigorous way to understand 'at the same time'?

### 4.4: The Calendar
- Day (Earth), month (based on moon cycles), and year (Sun)
- Chinese: 12-year cycle of Jupyter, retained in the Zodiac

```
day, month, year, zodiac cycle
earth, moon, sun, jupiter
```

- Julian calendar: year as 365.25 days
- Julian calendar differs from the true year by about 11 minutes. Reformation by Pope Gregory XIII.
- Gregorian calendar: only century years divisible by 400 are leap years; also move the calendar forward 10 days. The average length of the Gregorian calendar is correct to 1 day in 3300 years
- Gregorian calendar was adopted immediately by catholic countries and later by other countries
- Russia did not abandon the Julian calendar until the Bolshevik revolution; Russians omitted 13 days to sync with the rest of the world.

### 4.5: Phases and Motions of the Moon
- The Moon glows from reflected sunlight
- The Moon follows phases
- The Sun moves 1/12 of its path around the sky every month
- How much of the face we see illuminated by sunlight depends on the angle the Sun makes with the Moon
- Moon -- new when it is between the sun and the Earth -- the moon is invisibile to us
- It takes 30 days for the moon to orbit the Earth
- lunacy -- lunar
- Sidereal month: 27.3217 days -- period of revolution about Earth measured wrt the stars.
- Moon rotates on its axis in the same time it takes to revolve around the earth; and so it always keeps the same face towards Earth. *Synchronous rotation*.
  - **Q:** This seems like too good of a coincidence to be true. Why?

### 4.6: Ocean Tides and the Moon
- The Earth is not perfectly rigid
- The moon exerts gravitational forces on the Earth
- Earth is an oblate spheroid
- Tide forces produce tidal bulges in the oceans; water gathers towards the moon.
- Neap tides: when the moon is in the 1st or last quarter, tides produced byt he sun partially cancel tides of the moon
- However, land masses stop the flow of water, the ocean has variable depth, etc.; so tides change a lot.

### 4.7: Eclipses of the Sun and Moon
- An object in the solar system casts a shadow when it blocks the light of the Sun
- Eclipse: any part of the earth or moon enters the shadow of the other
- Moon's shadow strikes earth: people in the shadow see the sun partially covered by the moon (solar eclipse)
- Earth passes into the shadow of earth: people in the night side of Earth see the moon darken (lunar eclipse)
- Umbra: cone where the shadow is darkest; penumbra: where the shadow is more diffuse
- A lunar eclipse is visible to everyone who can see the moon
- Even when eclipsed, the Moon appears red (why?) **Q**
- Corona: the thn outer atmosphere of the Sun visible during a total solar eclipse.

## Chapter 7: Other Worlds: An Introduction to the Solar System

### 7.1: Overview of Our Planetary System
- Sun and smaller objects -- planets, moons, rings, debris
- Objects formed with the Sun about 4.5b years ago
- The sun is brighter than 80% of stars in the galaxy
- The sun is the largest member of the solar system, accounting for 99.80% of total mass
- Most material is concentrated in JUpiter
- Most planets follow orbits in a concentric plane
- Four planets closest to the sun -- terrestrial planets
  - Sometimes the moon is included here
- Jupiter through Neptune -- the jovial or giant planets
- Only Mercury and Venus move through space without a moon
- Giant planets have rings made up of many small bodies in orbit around the equator of the planet.
- Asteroids -- rocky bodies which orbit the sun like minitiar planets
- Comets: small bodies composed mostly of ice, frozen gases, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide
- When grains of brkoen rock (cosmic dust) enter the atmosphere, they burn up and produce meteors; when they hit the ground, they are meteriorites

### 7.2: Composition and Structure of Planets
- There are two distinct kinds of planets, so it is likely that they formed under different conditions.
- The giant planets -- the two largest planets (Jupiter and Saturn) have the same chemical makeup as the Sun -- hydrogen and helium, 75% mass hydrogen and 25% helium.
- Jupiter and Saturn are so large that their gas is compressed until hyodrgne becomes a liquid. They really should be called liquid planets.
- Jupyiter and Saturn have heavy rock, metal, and ice regions
- Giant planets have hydrogen and many other compounds.
- Hydrogen-dominated composition: reduced
- Terrestial planets: the most abundant rocks (silicates) are made of silicon and oxygen; most common metal is iron. Mercury has the greatest proportion of metals
- Densest metals are in the center; lighter silicates are near the surface.
- Differentiation: gravity helps separate a planet's interior into different layers.
- Earth's moon is like terrestrial planets
- Most moons have a similar composition tot he bodies they orbit
- THe farther a body from the Sun, the cooler the surface. 
  - Temperature decreases in proportion with the square root of distance from the sun
- Earth is the only planet where surface temperatures lie between freezing and boiling points of water; the only planet to support life.
- Geological activity -- crusts of all terrestrial planets have been modified over time by internal and external forces.
- All planets are subject to impacts -- geological activity is the result of a hot interior
- The Moon is geologically dead -- Mercury ceased most volcanic activity about the same time as the Moon.
- Primordial heat 'powered' bodies -- the larger the body, the better it retains its internal heat
  - Is there any regeneration of heat in these bodies? Where does the heat from dead planets go to?

## Philosophical Relevance
Personal notes
- Ptolemization (reactionary) vs Copernican (revolutionary, new coordinates)
- Ptolemization requires an increasingly complex series of mecahnisms to accomodate reality
- Eratosthenes: measure the world with an angle (particularity to understand universality)
- Horoscopes: the arbitrariness of the scientific factors we choose to determine ourselves.
- Astronomists adopt the fictitious celestial sphere to literally define the coordinates of the sky.
- We need a star to measure and mark time
- Calendars: the necessity of time and the flacidity of skipping time
- Lunar eclipse: anyone who can see the moon can watch it be eclipsed by the ground they stand upon
