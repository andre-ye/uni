## Chapter 1: Science and the Universe -- A Brief Tour

### 1.1: The Nature of Astronomy
- Astronomy -- obejcts which lie beyond Earth
- Humanity's attempt to formulate a *history of the universe*

### 1.2: The Nature of Science
- Science is a method through which we acquire knowledge
- Models as ideal approximations of nature
- Note -- astronomy has an intimate relationship with models
- Hypothesis must be testable with experimentation
- Astronomy as an observational and a historical science. This is interesting epistemically.
- Science is self-correcting. (is it?)

### 1.3: The Laws of Nature
- Rules by which nature plays
- Universal laws held by induction
- Imposition of laws across neighborhoods for consistency.
- General relativity and black holes
- The limitations of language necessitates mathematics

### 1.4: Numbers in Astronomy
- Scientific notation
- Light year -- the distance light travels in one year. Fastest speed in the universe.

### 1.5: Consequences of Light Travel Time
- Information in the universe almost exclusively comes to us in forms of light.
- The speed of light is the limit on how quickly we can learn about the universe.
- Now is when light reaches us on earth.
- The old age of cosmic light allows us to better trace a cosmic history.

### 1.6: A Tour of the Universe
- Moon -- Earth's satellite. 
- Light takes 1.3 seconds to travel from the moon to the earth.
- Distance between the earth and the sun is an astronomical unit (AU).
- Earth is one of eight planets which go around the sun.
- The Sun is a local star
- Galaxy -- Milky Way Galaxy -- a giant disk with a small ball
- The space between stars is not completely empty, it has some gas and some small particles
- Interstellar material is very sparse
- Dust in space can block up light of distant stars
- Dark matter -- its gravity is exerted on stars, but we do not know what it is made of.
- Some stars are involved in double or triple systems
- No star lasts forever; eventually all stars run out of fuel.

### 1.7: The Universe on the Large Scale
- The universe is made up of a large number of galaxies.
- Universe: everything accessible to our observations
- Galaxies -- island universes, groups of stars in intergalactic space
- Local group -- a cluster of about 50 galaxies
- Galaxies occur mostly in clusters, large and small
- Superclusters -- Virgo Supercluster, local group is part of this
- Quasars -- centers of galaxies. These are the brightest things we can see, including close to the big bang explosion which begins time.

### 1.8: The Universe of the Very Small
- The Galaxy is mostly empty space
- One atom per cubic centimeter in interstellar Galaxy gas
- Dense places like the human body are very rare in the universe
- Cosmically abundant elements: hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen

## Chapter 2: Observing the Sky -- The Birth of Astronomy
### 2.1: The Sky Above
- Geocentric view: humans as the central focus of the cosmos. 
- One of the great monuments of our intellectual history is to overthrow geocentrism.
- Zenith -- point directly above you; horizon -- dome meets surface of Earth
- Celestial sphere, Greeks
- North and south celestial pole
- The sun changes position
- The Sun takes a ecliptic path
- Fixed and wandering stars
- Planets -- wandering stars; planet means wanderer in ancient Greek
- Constellations: geometric patterns formed by groupings of stars
- Telescopes reveal millions of stars which are too small for the eye to see
- Constellation refers to 88 sectors of the sky

### 2.2: Ancient Astronomy
- Ancient astronomers were able to grasp the length of a year
- Cosmology: our concept of the basics tructure and origin of the cosmos
- Eastern Mediterraneans knew Earth was round; Pythagoras may have pioneered round earthers
- Parallax: the apparent shift in the direction of an object as a result of the motion of the observer
- Stellar parallax: shift in the apparent direction of a star due to Earth's orbital motion. Stars however did not seem to shift in spring vs in fall, when Earth is on the opposite side of the sun.

> This meant either that Earth was not moving or that the stars had to be so tremendously far away that the parallax shift was immeasurably small. A cosmos of such enormous extent required a leap of imagination that most ancient philosophers were not prepared to make, so they retreated to the safety of the Earth-centered view, which would dominate Western thinking for nearly two millennia.

- Eratosthenes: measuring a single angle in one region allowed for determining the size of th Earth.
- Hipparchus: measured positions of objects in the sky and provided the coordinates for understanding this world. The position in the sky over the north pole changed over the previous 1.5 century. Earth must be doing the wobbling. **Precession**: the direction in which Earth's axis points
- Ptolemy: geometric representation of the solar system which predicted the position oft he planets.
- Epicycle: each planet revolves in a local circle as well as in a broader circle. However it was in fact that the planets travelled in ellipses; circles do not work.
- Will the revolution be Copernican or a Ptolemization? -- a Ptolemization requires increasing complex analyse sand mechanisms to make it work.

### 2.3: Astrology and Astronomy
- Planets and stars as symbols of gods and the supernatural, the metaphysical (technology is the making of the metaphysical into the physical)
- Astrology begins in Babylon
- Natal astrology -- Ptolemy, the *Tetrabiblos*. An ancient religion of shorts
- Horoscopes -- mappings of birth to the position of stars in the sky
- Astrologists posit unknown forces exerted by planets -- epistemic inaccess
- Why do we identify with horoscopes? Maybe they are true in the more philosophical sense, that we feel the need to identify a particularity of ourselves, and the truth of the horoscope -- and its sadness -- is that this particularity is totally arbitrary. So maybe we should think about how even if we turn away from astrological horoscopes, we turn towards other horoscopes -- my college major, my interests, my quirkiness, etc.

### 2.4: The Birth of Modern Astronomy
- Many names for stars come from Arabic
- Copernicus -- new Sun-centered, heliocentric model of the solar system
- If Earthw were moving, we would feel this motion -- objection to Copernian revolution. 
- Copernicus could not prove the Earth revolves around the Sun, but appealed to the lack of beauty in Ptolemaic cosmology.
- Galileo: pioneered many modern principles of science
  - Greatest contributions were to mechanics
  - Acceleration 
  - Pioneered telescope
  - Interesting question -- what is the believability of microscopes? What does it mean to see something as if you had a 'small eye'?
- Galileo confirmed the Copernican hypothesis
- The Roman Catholic Church condmened Galileo.
- Modernity: nature is rational and ultimately knowable through experimetns and observations
-

## Chapter 3: Orbits and Gravity
### 3.1: The Laws of Planetary Motion
- Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler
- Brahe: recorded the loction of the sun, moon, and the planets
- Kepler helped understand the planetary data; developed Kepler's three laws
- Orbit: path of an object through space. Orbits are ellipses
- Major axis (widest) and semimajor axis
- Eccentricity: ratio of distance between foci to the length of the major axis
- First law: orbits of all planets are ellipses -- no need to move things in circles.
- Second law: planets speed up when they come closer to the sun and slow down when they get away. The area swept out in space over time along the orbit relative to the sun is always equal in equal intervals of time.
- Third law: a planet's orbital period squared is proportional to the semimajor axis of its orbit cubed
  - A planet's semimajor axis is equal to its average distance from the sun
  - Orbital period: time it takes for a planet to travel once around the sun
  - When the orbital period is measured in years and the semimajor axis in AUs, $$P^2 = a^3$$
  
### 3.2: Newton's Great Synthesis
- Science first called natural philosophy
- Newton's first law: an object will continue to be in a state of rest or move at a constant speed in a straight line without external influence
  - Conservation of momentum
  - Momentum: mass times velocity
- Newton's second law: the change of motion of a body is proportional to and in the direction of the force acting on it
  - A force is required to change speed and/or direction
- Newton's third law: for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction
  - Acceleration of a body is proportional to the force being applied to it. 
  - Generalization of the first law
  - Lets us define mass
  - In a system isolated from outside influences, total momentum of objects should remain constant (law 1)
  - Change in momentum *has to be balanced* by another change which is equal and opposite
  - There is always a pair of forces; if a force is exerted on an object, the object exerts another equal and opposite force.
  - What really is force as formalized?
- Mass -- measure of material in an object
- Volume -- amount of physical space occupied
- Density -- mass per volume
- Angular momentum: measure of rotation of a body revolving around a fixed point
- Kepler's second law: conservation of anglar momentum

### 3.3: Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation
- Newton: gravity causes planets to move in ellipses, rather than straight lines (as per the first law)
- Pre-Newton: gravity applies only to Earth.
- Earth's gravity can extend as far as the moon and curve the path to a straight line.
- Universal attraction among all bodies everywhere in space
- Newton invented calculus to deal with problems in universal attraction
- Magnitude of the force of gravity must decrease with increasing distance between the sun and the planet in proportion to the inverse square of their separation
- Gravity gives us our sense of weight
- Why does the moon not fall in? Why in general would bodies orbit and not spiral out or in? It seems like equilibrium is fragile
- Gravity is built into the concept of mass: wherever there is mass, there is attraction.
- What constitutes a 'body'? Because if you break it down all it really is is atoms together, right? Is it density? How are we defining an object? Isn't that kind of a subjective imposition?
- Gravity can never become zero, even though it can become infinitely weaker
- Astronauts feel weightless because they are falling: you accelerate at the same rate as everything around you, and so you experience no additional forces. So you continue to fall through, but not towards earth but around it.
- Orbital motion and mass: factoring in masses shows us that the orbital period squared times the sum of the two bodies' masses equals the semimajor axis cubed.

### 3.4: Orbits in the Solar System
- Place where planet is closest to Sun: perihelion
  - Farthest away: aphelion
  - Orbiting Earth: perigee, apogee
- All planets have low-eccentric orbits except for Mercury (0.21)
- Comets have larger orbit sizes and eccentiricites than asteroids

### 3.5: Motions of Satellites and Spacecraft
- The behavior of an artificial satellite is the same as that of natural satellites
- Circular satellite velocity -- speed needed to fall around Earth
- Escape speed: speed needed to move away from Earth forever
- Spacecraft sometimes use gravity to direct spacecraft to another target, like 'swingbys'.

### 3.6: Gravity with More Than Two Bodies
- All planets exert gravity on themselves as well. 
- Discovery of Neptune
- Uranus -- originally recorded as a star. Herschel discovers that some planets are too dim to be unaided but are visible with a telescope.
- Uranus does not move in an orbit predicted by Newtonian theory: another planet is influencing its trajectory, Neptune. 
- Proved the generality of Newton's laws.

## Chapter 4: Earth, Moon, and Sky

### 4.1: Earth and Sky
- Great circle -- any circle whose center is at the center of the sphere
- Meidian
- Longitude of the prime meridian is 0 degrees; it passes through Greenwich, England.
- Declination and right ascension: make use of a fictitious celestial sphere.
- Why does the Earth turn? Jean Foucault and the pendulum

### 4.2: The Seasons
- There are significant variations in heat received from the Sun throughout the year
- Seasons: different amount of sunlight.
- Seasons are not the result of changing distance between the earth and the sun. Seasons are actually caused by the 23.5 degree tilt of the Earth's axis.
- Arctic and Antarctic circles -- the place where sun can hit all day long
- Hottest months are July and August because the Sun progressively heats it up even after the summer solstice

### 4.3: Keeping Time
- Solar day: rotation period of Earth w.r.t. the Sun
- Sidereal day: defined in terms of rotation period of Earth w.r.t. stars
- **Why can't we just measure how much Earth rotates 'on its own'? **
- Apparent solar time: actual position of the Sun in the sky, given by sundials. 
- Mean solar time: average value of the solar day over the course of the year. 24 hours
- Standardization of time zones: noon is different for everyone
- Travelers reset watches only when time change accumulates to a full hour.
- New time zone ever 15 degrees longitude. 
- International Date Line: set at 180 degree meridian. By convention the date of the calendar is changed.

> To maintain our planet on a rational system of timekeeping, we simply must accept that the date will differ in different cities at the same time.

- What is time, really? Because I can't observe something happening in Japan at the same time. What is the rigorous way to understand 'at the same time'?

### 4.4: The Calendar
- Day (Earth), month (based on moon cycles), and year (Sun)
- Chinese: 12-year cycle of Jupyter, retained in the Zodiac

```
day, month, year, zodiac cycle
earth, moon, sun, jupiter
```

- Julian calendar: year as 365.25 days
- Julian calendar differs from the true year by about 11 minutes. Reformation by Pope Gregory XIII.
- Gregorian calendar: only century years divisible by 400 are leap years; also move the calendar forward 10 days. The average length of the Gregorian calendar is correct to 1 day in 3300 years
- Gregorian calendar was adopted immediately by catholic countries and later by other countries
- Russia did not abandon the Julian calendar until the Bolshevik revolution; Russians omitted 13 days to sync with the rest of the world.

### 4.5: Phases and Motions of the Moon
- The Moon glows from reflected sunlight
- The Moon follows phases
- The Sun moves 1/12 of its path around the sky every month
- How much of the face we see illuminated by sunlight depends on the angle the Sun makes with the Moon
- Moon -- new when it is between the sun and the Earth -- the moon is invisibile to us
- It takes 30 days for the moon to orbit the Earth
- lunacy -- lunar
- Sidereal month: 27.3217 days -- period of revolution about Earth measured wrt the stars.
- Moon rotates on its axis in the same time it takes to revolve around the earth; and so it always keeps the same face towards Earth. *Synchronous rotation*.
  - **Q:** This seems like too good of a coincidence to be true. Why?

### 4.6: Ocean Tides and the Moon
- The Earth is not perfectly rigid
- The moon exerts gravitational forces on the Earth
- Earth is an oblate spheroid
- Tide forces produce tidal bulges in the oceans; water gathers towards the moon.
- Neap tides: when the moon is in the 1st or last quarter, tides produced byt he sun partially cancel tides of the moon
- However, land masses stop the flow of water, the ocean has variable depth, etc.; so tides change a lot.

### 4.7: Eclipses of the Sun and Moon
- An object in the solar system casts a shadow when it blocks the light of the Sun
- Eclipse: any part of the earth or moon enters the shadow of the other
- Moon's shadow strikes earth: people in the shadow see the sun partially covered by the moon (solar eclipse)
- Earth passes into the shadow of earth: people in the night side of Earth see the moon darken (lunar eclipse)
- Umbra: cone where the shadow is darkest; penumbra: where the shadow is more diffuse
- A lunar eclipse is visible to everyone who can see the moon
- Even when eclipsed, the Moon appears red (why?) **Q**
- Corona: the thn outer atmosphere of the Sun visible during a total solar eclipse.

## Chapter 7: Other Worlds: An Introduction to the Solar System

### 7.1: Overview of Our Planetary System
- Sun and smaller objects -- planets, moons, rings, debris
- Objects formed with the Sun about 4.5b years ago
- The sun is brighter than 80% of stars in the galaxy
- The sun is the largest member of the solar system, accounting for 99.80% of total mass
- Most material is concentrated in JUpiter
- Most planets follow orbits in a concentric plane
- Four planets closest to the sun -- terrestrial planets
  - Sometimes the moon is included here
- Jupiter through Neptune -- the jovial or giant planets
- Only Mercury and Venus move through space without a moon
- Giant planets have rings made up of many small bodies in orbit around the equator of the planet.
- Asteroids -- rocky bodies which orbit the sun like minitiar planets
- Comets: small bodies composed mostly of ice, frozen gases, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide
- When grains of brkoen rock (cosmic dust) enter the atmosphere, they burn up and produce meteors; when they hit the ground, they are meteriorites

### 7.2: Composition and Structure of Planets
- There are two distinct kinds of planets, so it is likely that they formed under different conditions.
- The giant planets -- the two largest planets (Jupiter and Saturn) have the same chemical makeup as the Sun -- hydrogen and helium, 75% mass hydrogen and 25% helium.
- Jupiter and Saturn are so large that their gas is compressed until hyodrgne becomes a liquid. They really should be called liquid planets.
- Jupyiter and Saturn have heavy rock, metal, and ice regions
- Giant planets have hydrogen and many other compounds.
- Hydrogen-dominated composition: reduced
- Terrestial planets: the most abundant rocks (silicates) are made of silicon and oxygen; most common metal is iron. Mercury has the greatest proportion of metals
- Densest metals are in the center; lighter silicates are near the surface.
- Differentiation: gravity helps separate a planet's interior into different layers.
- Earth's moon is like terrestrial planets
- Most moons have a similar composition tot he bodies they orbit
- THe farther a body from the Sun, the cooler the surface. 
  - Temperature decreases in proportion with the square root of distance from the sun
- Earth is the only planet where surface temperatures lie between freezing and boiling points of water; the only planet to support life.
- Geological activity -- crusts of all terrestrial planets have been modified over time by internal and external forces.
- All planets are subject to impacts -- geological activity is the result of a hot interior
- The Moon is geologically dead -- Mercury ceased most volcanic activity about the same time as the Moon.
- Primordial heat 'powered' bodies -- the larger the body, the better it retains its internal heat
  - Is there any regeneration of heat in these bodies? Where does the heat from dead planets go to?

### 7.3: Dating Planetary Surfaces
- How do we know how old planets and moons are?
- Counting the craters -- count ght enumber of impact craters; we can assume a certain uniform rate of craters
- You can also track radioactive rocks
- Natural radioactivity: some atomic nuclei are not stable but can spontaneously decay into smaller nuclei, which produces gamma rays
- Decay is random in nature but radioactive substances generally have a half-half

### 7.4: Origin of the Solar System
- Much of astronomy is motivated by a desire to understand *origins*
- Superearths -- planets in between terrestrial and giant planet sizes
- Some exoplanet systems have giant planets close to a star.
- We look for patterns among our planets. ALl planets lie on the same plan and spin around its own access. The Sun and planets formed together in a solar nebula.
- The sun has the same hydrogen composition as Jupiter and Saturn.  Processes which led to planet formation in the inner solar system likewise excluded lighter materials
- Many stars in space are younger than the sun; solar nebulas which can resemble our own solar system.
- Theoretical calculations can help us see how solid bodies might form from gas and dust
- Precursors of planets: planetesimals.
- Violentness of planetesimals
- Solar nebula model can explain many regularities in the solar system

## Chapter 8: Earth as a Planet

### 8.1: The Global Perspective
- Earth's orbit is almost circular
- Earth is warm enough to support liquid water
- In many ways we know less about our own planet 5 km below us than the surfcaes of Venus and Mars: we have to determine composition indirectly.
- Seismic studies measure difference in refraction of waves traveling through different compositions
- Crust (6 km thick, basalt); mantle (2900 km, ~solid, possibly molten); core (7000 diameter; probably solid -- high density iron, nickel, sulfur)
- Differentiation: sorting of components by density: at one time it was warm enough for the interior to melt
- Earth behaves like a magnet aligned with north and south generated by moving liquid metal
- Magnetosphere: Earth's magnetic field dominates interplanetary magnet field.
- Solar wind -- provides particles for Earth's magnetic sphere to trap.

### 8.2: Earth's Crust
- Oceanic basalt and continental granite: both igenous rock, or rock which cools from a molten state
- Sedimentary rocks -- fragments of igneous rock deposited by wind or water without melting
- Metamorphic rocks -- produced when high temperature alters igenous/sedimentary rock chemically
- Primitive rock: escapes chemical modificiation by heating; is made of the original material of Earth. We can't find this on Earth though
- Plate tectonics -- slow convection motions in the mantle move large segments of crust, resulting in gradual drifting.
- Rift zones -- upswelling currents in the mantle; molten rock rises to fill space in between receding plates
- Ocean basins are one of the yougnest features of the planet
- Subduction zone -- where one place is forced below another one. Thin oceanic planets can be thrust into the upper mantle. This forms an ocean trench. The plate eventually melts. Amount of crust destroyed at subduction zones $$\approx$$ amount of crust created at rift zones.
- Faults -- plate boundaries where crustal plates slide against each other.
- Faults may form mountains -- plates rubbing against each other 
- Planets without moving ice or water like the moon or mercury have smooth mountains
- Volcanoes: lava rises tot he surface

### 8.3: Earth's Atmosphere
- We live at the bottom of an 'ocean of air'
- 1 bar: pressure of the atmosphere at sea level.
- Humans have evolved to live at a bar of pressure.
- Most of the atmosphere is concentrated near the surface of the earth (troposphere)
- Temperature decreases rapidly with increasing elevation
- Stratosphere: cold, no clouds
- On top of the stratosphere is ozone; it protects the surface from Sun's radiation.
- The atmosphere is very thin above 100km; satellites can pass with little fraction
- Continuous leaking of the atmosphere of lightweight atoms
- The atmosphere is mostly nitrogen and oxygen, with some argon. 
- Weather -- circulation of the atmosphere; energy from sunlight.
- Climate: effects of the atmosphere through decades and centuries; changes in climate can accumulate
- "Climate is what you expect, and weather is what you get"

## Chapter 9: Cratered Worlds
### 9.1: General Properties of the Moon
- The moon's mass and gravity is too low to retain an atmosphere
- Lunar geology
- Lunar exploration cut off due to political and economic pressures
- The composition of the Moon -- mainly silicate rock; delted in iron and other metals. 
- Water ice detected in permanently shadowed craters near the lunar poles.
- Polar water presumably carried to moon by comets and asteroids
- Possible human habitation near the lunar poles?

### 9.2: The Lunar Surface
- 'the man in the moon' -- large areas of dark lava flows
- Dark 'seas'
- Rocks on the moon are substantially older than rocks on Earth
- Lunar highlands -- crust with silicate rocks
- Highlands do not have sharp folds, but rather low, rounded profiles
- On the lunar surface
- The surface of the moon is buried under a fine-grained soil of tiny, shattered rock fragments; upper layers are porous
- Lunar surfaces have more extreme temperatures than the erth due to not having air.

### 9.3: Impact Craters
- Moon is an important becnhmark for understanding the history of the planetary system -- solid bodies leave behind the traces of impacts
- Cratering process: impact, vaproziation, ejection of material, most ejected material falls back in the crater but some fall outside and make an ejecta blanket.
- Crater -- Greek, 'bowl'
- By estimating crater creation rates, we can roughly date the moon

## Chapter 11: The Giant Planets
### 11.1: Exploring the Outer Planets
- Giant planets hold most of the mass in the planetary system
- Jupiter exceeds the mass of all other planets combined
- Gases, ices, rocks
- Challenges in exploring the giant planets - flight times measured in years to decades
- Messages take hours to pass between Earth and the spacecraft even at the speed of light
- Spacecraft sent to the outer solar system must be highly reliable and autonomy; also must carry their own energy sources
- Voyagers 1 and 2 -- farthest spacecraft
- Every 175 years, planets are in a position so that a single sapcecraft can visit them all with gravity-assisted flybys ('the grand tour')
- Galileo, Cassini, Juno orbiters

### 11.2: The Giant Planets
- Uranus and Neptune have a mass about 15 times as much as the Earth
- Clouds of Jupiter and Saturn are made of ammonia crystals
- Neptune -- clouds of methane
- Uranus -- no visible cloud layer
- Jupiter has the shortest day of a planet -- rotation period of almost 10 hours
- Earth and Mars have seasons because of tilted spin axes. Jupiter does not have much of a tilt, but Saturn and Neptune both do. Uranus orbits essentially on its side.
- Uranus has dramatic seasons 
- Jupiter and Saturn -- mostly hydrogen and helium interior -- only possible materials
- Planets are so big; gasses are extraordinarily compressed
- Hydrogen turns from gaseous to liquid state in JUpiter and Saturn; deeper, it can act like a metal
- Jupiter is the hottest; largest internal energy source. Cross between a star (internal energy source) and a normal atmosphere (energy from Sun)
- Saturn is still differentiating
- Uranus and Neptune   -- no internal energy and some, respectively
- Magnetospheres -- regionsa round a planet where the planet's magnetic field dominates the general one.
- Jupiter was a source of radio waaves that get more intense at longer rather than shorter wavelengths -- synchotron radiation (Jupiter has a strong magneitc field)

### 11.3: The Atmospheres of the Giant Planets
- Atmospheric gases leave fingerprints in the spectrum of light
- Different gasses freeze at different temperatures
- Clouds we see around planets are frozen ammonia crystals.
- Saturn: hexgonal wave pattern in North Pole
- Uranus is entirely featureless -- methane rather than ammonia clouds.
- Neptune has convection currents in its atmosphere, which cause cloud movement
- Many regions of high pressure
- Heat from the insdie contributes as much energy to the atmosphere as unlight to hte outside except Uranus. 
- Oval shaped highh-pressure regions on Jupiter; Great Red Spot, a giant storm in the atmosphere
- Jupiter has no solid surface to slow down atmosphered isturbances
- Photochemistry: chemical changes caused by electromagnetic radiation

## Chapter 12: Rings, Moons, and Pluto

### 12.1: Ring and Moon Systems Introduced
- Rings and moons in the outer solar system have different composition than those in the inner solar system; this is given by different cooling procedures during formation
- 1/3 of moons in the outer solar sytem are in direct orbits -- west to east direction along the equator.
- Retrograde: east to waste or high eccentricity or high inclination -- located far from the planet
- Jupiter has 79 known moons and a faint rings
  - 4 large moons -- Callisto, Ganymede, Europe, Io, discovered in 1610 by Galileo -- these are Galilean moons
  - Most of Jupiter's moons are retrograde orbits very very far from Jupiter
- Saturn has > 82 known moons and many rings
  - Titan -- only moon with a substantial atmosphere and lakes / seas of liquid hydrocarbons
  - Enceladus -- active water geysers
  - Saturn's rings are collections of ice fragments orbiting Saturn in a traffice pattern
- Uranus: Ring and moon system is tilted at 98 degrees
  - 11 rings
  - 27 known moons
- Neptune
  - 14 known moons
  - Triton: large moon in retrograde, which is unusual

### 12.2: The Galilean Moons of Jupiter
- From 1996 to 1999, Galileo spacecraft went through the jovian system and had close encounters with Galilean moons
- Callisto
  - Outermost moon
  - Large distance from Jupiter
  - Callisto rotates in the same period as it revolves; keeps the same face towards jupiter
  - Callisto's day is its month
  - Low surface temperature; permannet water ice
  - Callisto is not fully differentiated
  - Callisto covered with impact craters
- Ganymede
  - Largest moon in the solar system
  - Has a lot of cratering
  - Ganymede is a differentriated world
  - Rock sinks to form a core about the size of the moon
  - Ganymede has a magnetic field and intermittent geological activity
  - Tidal heating -- gravitational flexing due to the gravity grap of Jupiter
- Europe
  - Has an ocean, wau
  - Acquired the majority share of ice; infrared radiation vaporized ice near Jupiter, leaivng Europa and Io with compositions similar to inner planets
  - Europa is more geologically active than Earth
  - Europa has a very complicated surface, with quasi straight lines. Form if it floats without much friction on liquid water.
  - A global ocean on Europa
  - Europa -- only palce in the solar system other than Earth with large amounts of liquid water
  - Ocean must be warmed by heat escaping the interior of Europa
  - Life derives its energy from minimeral laden water. Maybe there is life under Europa?
- Io
  - A close twin of the moon
  - Has very high volcanism; plumes which extend several 100 kms out in space
  - A lot of volcanism on Io has hot silicate lava
- Tidal heating
  - Effect of gravity through tidal heating
  - If Io always kept the same face towards Jupiter, the bulge would not generate heat; but because of its uncircularity, it twists back and forth, which generates heat

### 12.3: Titan and Triton
- Saturn's largest moon Titan has similarities to Earth's moon
  - Titan, seen in 1655
  - First moon discovered after the Galilean moons
  - Titan has a thick atmosphere and lakes and rivers and falling rain
  - Only moon or planet other than Earth with bodies of surface liquids
  - Atmospheric methane can condense and fall as rain
- Triton
  - Largest of Neptune's moons
  - 75% rock, 25% water ice
  - Coldest temperature of any visited body
  - Small atmosphere
  - Long history of geological evolution

### 12.4: Pluto and Charon
- Is Pluto a planet?
- Uranus has slight departures from its predicted orbit
- Pluto could not have exerted any measurable pull on Uranus; the reported small anomalies were in fact not real
- Pluto is not a giant like the 4 outer solar system planets
- Pluto has a moon Charon and four much smaller moons. 
  - Maybe Pluto and Charon are double worlds
- Pluto is an odd cousin -- Pluto is not unique: Eris, Makemake. A dwarf planet -- planet much smaller than the terrestrial planets
- Asteroid Ceres initially hailed as a planet
- Pluto's surface is highly reflective; partial sublimation
- Pluto is not geologically dead, even though it is so small. Remarkable geological activity
- Charon keeps the same size towards Plato and vice versa -- the two constantly face each other. A double tidal lock

### 12.5: Planetary Rings and Enceladus
- All 4 giant planets have rings
- Each ring system has billions of moonlets / small particles
- Rings have a complicated structure related to interactions between ring particles and larger moons
- A ring -- collection of many many particles, each like a tiny moon which follow's Kepler's laws
- The ring does not rotate as a solid body -- a ring is not really a thing rotating
- Rings of Saturn and uranus; particles are close enough to exert gravitational influence; sometimes rub together and bounce off each other
- How did rings come to be?
  - Breakup hypothesis: rings are remains of a shattered moon broken by a passing comet or asteroid; tidal forces disperse it into a disk
  - Breakin hypothesis: rings are particles who are unable to come together to form a moon
- Gravity is important -- tidal forces can drastically change the dynamics
- Saturn's rings are broad and very thin
- Enceladus: possible subsurface ocean of water feeding the geysers which is conveniently escapign into space
- Uranus has narrow and black rings discovered by occultation
- Neptune's rings do not have evenly distributed rings
- Planetary rings have intricate structures, which is why they are interesting.
  - Without moons, there would be no rings, because the small particles would dissipate
- Gaps in Saturn's rings are gravitational resonances from smaller innoer moons; resonance: ratios of gravity

## Chapter 13: Comets and Asteroids: Debris of the Solar System

### 13.1: Asteroids
- Most asteroids are found between Mars and Jupiter, in the asteroid belt
- Largest asteroid -- Ceres, diameter of 1k km, but reclassified as a dwarf planet
- Pallas and Vesta
- Asteroids revolve around the Sun in the same direction as the planets 
- Asteroid belt -- between Mars and Jupiter
- Asteroids are not dense; typical spacing between objects is several million kilometers; this allows spacecrafft to travel through the asteroid belt without collision
- Some asteroids fall into families
- Asteroids are generally very dark -- primitive bodies which change little since the beginningo f the solar system -- C-type asteroids
- S-type asteroids: stony or silicate; chemically primitive also
- M-type asteroids: metalic, much better reflector; probably came from a  parent body shattered in a collision
  - There is enough metal in a 1-km M-type asteroid to supply the world with iron and industrial metals for the forseeable future
- Vesta -- the surface is covered with basalt, meaning it is differentiated and that it once must have been volcanically active even though it is small (500km diameter)
- Gaspra and Ida -- 1955 Galileo encounter
  - Ida has a moon (Dactyl) in orbit around the asteroid
- Large objects are pulled by their own gravity into spherical shapes
- Discovery of an interstellar asteroid on a larger orbit -- dscovered in late 2017 leaving the inner solar system

### 13.2: Asteroids and Planetary Defense
- Asteroids which stray away from the main belt are interesting
- Asteroids which come inwards are of interest to people on Earth
- Comets which come close to the planet and asteroids are near-Earth objects (NEOs)
- A 1 km or higher asteroid could cause global damage; blocking sunlight; etc.
- None of the NEAs found so far will impact earth soon.
- We have about a 5-second warning that an asteroid orbit will hit earth
- Orbits of Earth-approaching asteroids are unstable over a long time
- Will humans defend themselves against an asteroid impact? Simple ways -- crash spacecraft into an asteroid
- A spacecraft impact can have a greater effect on certain types of asteroids than others

### 13.3: The Long-Haired Comets
- Comets have an icier composition, which makes them brighten a lot more when they approach the sun
- 'Hairy stars'
- Comet -- icy material which develops an atmosphere as it appraches the sun; later there will be  tail extending several million km away from the main body of the comet
- MOst comets appear at unpredictable times
- Comet Halley has been observed and recorded on every passage near the Sun since 239 BCE  every 74 - 79 years
- Halley's commet will return in 2061
- Short-period comets have orbits changed by coming too close to the giant planets
- Temporary atmosphere of gas and dust -- atmosphere is the comet's head / coma. The atmosphere is escaping all the time and needs a new source; this is the nuclear, which is the real comet -- the icy material
- Dirty snowball model, Fred Whipple (1950)
- The visual profile of comets come from the evaporation of cometary ices heated by sunlight
- Beyond the asteroid belt, comet ice is frozen
- A tail is an extension of the atmosphere; tails always point away from the sun, not along the comet's orbit. Comet tails are formed by the repulsive force of sunlight driving particles away from the head.
  - Dust tail: curves a little bit 
  - Ion tail: pushed more directly outward by the Sun
- Comet 67P's strange surface and features
  - Highly porous comet material

### 13.4: The Origin and Fate of Comets and Related Objects
- In the outer solar systme, objects contain a lot of water ice
- Pholus -- reddest surface of any object
- Centaurs -- distinction between asteroids and comets breaks down in the outer solar system
- Beyond the orbit of Neptune -- trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs), e.g. Pluto
- TNOs are part of the Kuiper belt
- Oort cloud: resevoir of ancient icy objects from which comets are derived
- Comets from the Oort cloud help us sample material very far from the Sun
- The fate of comets
  - Any comet we see today will have spent most of its existence in the Oort cloud or the Kuiper belt
  - May collide with the Sun or survive the passage around the Sun and rejoin its origins
  - Sometimes a comet interacts with a planet; it can impact the planet, speed up and be ejected out of the solar system, or come into orbit with a shorter period -- its lifetime begins being phased out.

## Chapter 14: Cosmic Samples and the Origin of the Solar System

### 14.1: Meteors
- Meteors are created as tiny solid particles which enter the atmosphere from interplanetary space
- Friction in the air vaporizes meteors 
- 'Shooting stars'
- Most meteors which strike the Earth are associated with the dust particles of a comet; when Earth crosses a dust stream we experience a meteor shower
- Perseid shower
- Comet dust is fluffy and burnsa way quickly

### 14.2: Meterorites -- Stones from Heaven
- Any interplanetary debris which survives the fall through Earth's atmosphere is a meteriorite
- Meterorite finds
- A lot of meteriorites landed in Antarctic
- There are irons, stones, and stony-irons
- Irons and stony irons are extraterrestrial
- The average age for most primitive meteriorites is 4.56b years
- Primitive vs differentiated (irons) meteriorites
- To understnad early solar system history, look at primitive meteriorites. Primitive stones
- Amino acids found on meteriorites -- maybe meteriorites brought amino acids to Earth

### 14.3: Formation of the Solar System
- Basic properties of the planetary system: motion, chemical, and age constraints.
- Retrograde reotation of Venus
- Progression from metal-rich and rocky planets to ice-dominated compositions
- Solar nebula
  - The solar systme formed 4.5bya from a rotating cloud of vapor and dust; collapsed under its own gravity
  - Forms a rotating disk
- Grains condensed in the solar nebula for planetsimals
- Accretion -- planetesimals grow large enough to attract neighbors gravitationally and grow from it
- Protoplanets continue to grow by accretion of planetesimals
- Planetary differentiation
- With ice and rocks, protoplanets grew to become much larger -- gradually cool to present state
- Collapse of gas explains hydrogen rich composition
- VIsible comets are on the tip of the 'cosmic icebirg'

## Philosophical Relevance
Personal notes
- Ptolemization (reactionary) vs Copernican (revolutionary, new coordinates)
- Ptolemization requires an increasingly complex series of mecahnisms to accomodate reality
- Eratosthenes: measure the world with an angle (particularity to understand universality)
- Horoscopes: the arbitrariness of the scientific factors we choose to determine ourselves.
- Astronomists adopt the fictitious celestial sphere to literally define the coordinates of the sky.
- We need a star to measure and mark time
- Calendars: the necessity of time and the flacidity of skipping time
- Lunar eclipse: anyone who can see the moon can watch it be eclipsed by the ground they stand upon
- In the discovery of Pluto, initially it was thought that a mysterious body must have been influencing Neptune because of reported anomalies in Neptune's path. However later it was shown that Pluto could not have influenced Neptune and that these recording anomalies were likely false. This is a sort of negation of proposition which in turn renders a positive result.
- Sublimation -- from solid to gas.
