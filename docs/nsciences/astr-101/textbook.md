## Chapter 1: Science and the Universe -- A Brief Tour

### 1.1: The Nature of Astronomy
- Astronomy -- obejcts which lie beyond Earth
- Humanity's attempt to formulate a *history of the universe*

### 1.2: The Nature of Science
- Science is a method through which we acquire knowledge
- Models as ideal approximations of nature
- Note -- astronomy has an intimate relationship with models
- Hypothesis must be testable with experimentation
- Astronomy as an observational and a historical science. This is interesting epistemically.
- Science is self-correcting. (is it?)

### 1.3: The Laws of Nature
- Rules by which nature plays
- Universal laws held by induction
- Imposition of laws across neighborhoods for consistency.
- General relativity and black holes
- The limitations of language necessitates mathematics

### 1.4: Numbers in Astronomy
- Scientific notation
- Light year -- the distance light travels in one year. Fastest speed in the universe.

### 1.5: Consequences of Light Travel Time
- Information in the universe almost exclusively comes to us in forms of light.
- The speed of light is the limit on how quickly we can learn about the universe.
- Now is when light reaches us on earth.
- The old age of cosmic light allows us to better trace a cosmic history.

### 1.6: A Tour of the Universe
- Moon -- Earth's satellite. 
- Light takes 1.3 seconds to travel from the moon to the earth.
- Distance between the earth and the sun is an astronomical unit (AU).
- Earth is one of eight planets which go around the sun.
- The Sun is a local star
- Galaxy -- Milky Way Galaxy -- a giant disk with a small ball
- The space between stars is not completely empty, it has some gas and some small particles
- Interstellar material is very sparse
- Dust in space can block up light of distant stars
- Dark matter -- its gravity is exerted on stars, but we do not know what it is made of.
- Some stars are involved in double or triple systems
- No star lasts forever; eventually all stars run out of fuel.

### 1.7: The Universe on the Large Scale
- The universe is made up of a large number of galaxies.
- Universe: everything accessible to our observations
- Galaxies -- island universes, groups of stars in intergalactic space
- Local group -- a cluster of about 50 galaxies
- Galaxies occur mostly in clusters, large and small
- Superclusters -- Virgo Supercluster, local group is part of this
- Quasars -- centers of galaxies. These are the brightest things we can see, including close to the big bang explosion which begins time.

### 1.8: The Universe of the Very Small
- The Galaxy is mostly empty space
- One atom per cubic centimeter in interstellar Galaxy gas
- Dense places like the human body are very rare in the universe
- Cosmically abundant elements: hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen

## Chapter 2: Observing the Sky -- The Birth of Astronomy
### 2.1: The Sky Above
- Geocentric view: humans as the central focus of the cosmos. 
- One of the great monuments of our intellectual history is to overthrow geocentrism.
- Zenith -- point directly above you; horizon -- dome meets surface of Earth
- Celestial sphere, Greeks
- North and south celestial pole
- The sun changes position
- The Sun takes a ecliptic path
- Fixed and wandering stars

### 2.2: Ancient Astronomy

### 2.3: Astrology and Astronomy
