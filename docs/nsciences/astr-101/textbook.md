## Chapter 1: Science and the Universe -- A Brief Tour

### 1.1: The Nature of Astronomy
- Astronomy -- obejcts which lie beyond Earth
- Humanity's attempt to formulate a *history of the universe*

### 1.2: The Nature of Science
- Science is a method through which we acquire knowledge
- Models as ideal approximations of nature
- Note -- astronomy has an intimate relationship with models
- Hypothesis must be testable with experimentation
- Astronomy as an observational and a historical science. This is interesting epistemically.
- Science is self-correcting. (is it?)

### 1.3: The Laws of Nature
- Rules by which nature plays
- Universal laws held by induction
- Imposition of laws across neighborhoods for consistency.
- General relativity and black holes
- The limitations of language necessitates mathematics

### 1.4: Numbers in Astronomy
- Scientific notation
- Light year -- the distance light travels in one year. Fastest speed in the universe.

### 1.5: Consequences of Light Travel Time
- Information in the universe almost exclusively comes to us in forms of light.
- The speed of light is the limit on how quickly we can learn about the universe.
- Now is when light reaches us on earth.
- The old age of cosmic light allows us to better trace a cosmic history.

### 1.6: A Tour of the Universe
- Moon -- Earth's satellite. 
- Light takes 1.3 seconds to travel from the moon to the earth.
- Distance between the earth and the sun is an astronomical unit (AU).
- Earth is one of eight planets which go around the sun.
- The Sun is a local star
- Galaxy -- Milky Way Galaxy -- a giant disk with a small ball
- The space between stars is not completely empty, it has some gas and some small particles
- Interstellar material is very sparse
- Dust in space can block up light of distant stars
- Dark matter -- its gravity is exerted on stars, but we do not know what it is made of.
- Some stars are involved in double or triple systems
- No star lasts forever; eventually all stars run out of fuel.

### 1.7: The Universe on the Large Scale
- The universe is made up of a large number of galaxies.
- Universe: everything accessible to our observations
- Galaxies -- island universes, groups of stars in intergalactic space
- Local group -- a cluster of about 50 galaxies
- Galaxies occur mostly in clusters, large and small
- Superclusters -- Virgo Supercluster, local group is part of this
- Quasars -- centers of galaxies. These are the brightest things we can see, including close to the big bang explosion which begins time.

### 1.8: The Universe of the Very Small
- The Galaxy is mostly empty space
- One atom per cubic centimeter in interstellar Galaxy gas
- Dense places like the human body are very rare in the universe
- Cosmically abundant elements: hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen

## Chapter 2: Observing the Sky -- The Birth of Astronomy
### 2.1: The Sky Above
- Geocentric view: humans as the central focus of the cosmos. 
- One of the great monuments of our intellectual history is to overthrow geocentrism.
- Zenith -- point directly above you; horizon -- dome meets surface of Earth
- Celestial sphere, Greeks
- North and south celestial pole
- The sun changes position
- The Sun takes a ecliptic path
- Fixed and wandering stars
- Planets -- wandering stars; planet means wanderer in ancient Greek
- Constellations: geometric patterns formed by groupings of stars
- Telescopes reveal millions of stars which are too small for the eye to see
- Constellation refers to 88 sectors of the sky

### 2.2: Ancient Astronomy
- Ancient astronomers were able to grasp the length of a year
- Cosmology: our concept of the basics tructure and origin of the cosmos
- Eastern Mediterraneans knew Earth was round; Pythagoras may have pioneered round earthers
- Parallax: the apparent shift in the direction of an object as a result of the motion of the observer
- Stellar parallax: shift in the apparent direction of a star due to Earth's orbital motion. Stars however did not seem to shift in spring vs in fall, when Earth is on the opposite side of the sun.

> This meant either that Earth was not moving or that the stars had to be so tremendously far away that the parallax shift was immeasurably small. A cosmos of such enormous extent required a leap of imagination that most ancient philosophers were not prepared to make, so they retreated to the safety of the Earth-centered view, which would dominate Western thinking for nearly two millennia.

- Eratosthenes: measuring a single angle in one region allowed for determining the size of th Earth.
- Hipparchus: measured positions of objects in the sky and provided the coordinates for understanding this world. The position in the sky over the north pole changed over the previous 1.5 century. Earth must be doing the wobbling. **Precession**: the direction in which Earth's axis points
- Ptolemy: geometric representation of the solar system which predicted the position oft he planets.
- Epicycle: each planet revolves in a local circle as well as in a broader circle. However it was in fact that the planets travelled in ellipses; circles do not work.
- Will the revolution be Copernican or a Ptolemization? -- a Ptolemization requires increasing complex analyse sand mechanisms to make it work.

### 2.3: Astrology and Astronomy
- Planets and stars as symbols of gods and the supernatural, the metaphysical (technology is the making of the metaphysical into the physical)
- Astrology begins in Babylon
- Natal astrology -- Ptolemy, the *Tetrabiblos*. An ancient religion of shorts
- Horoscopes -- mappings of birth to the position of stars in the sky
- Astrologists posit unknown forces exerted by planets -- epistemic inaccess
- Why do we identify with horoscopes? Maybe they are true in the more philosophical sense, that we feel the need to identify a particularity of ourselves, and the truth of the horoscope -- and its sadness -- is that this particularity is totally arbitrary. So maybe we should think about how even if we turn away from astrological horoscopes, we turn towards other horoscopes -- my college major, my interests, my quirkiness, etc.

## Chapter 4: Earth, Moon, and Sky

### 4.1: Earth and Sky
- Great circle -- any circle whose center is at the center of the sphere
- Meidian
- Longitude of the prime meridian is 0 degrees; it passes through Greenwich, England.
- Declination and right ascension: make use of a fictitious celestial sphere.
- Why does the Earth turn? Jean Foucault and the pendulum

### 4.2: The Seasons
- There are significant variations in heat received from the Sun throughout the year
- Seasons: different amount of sunlight.
- Seasons are not the result of changing distance between the earth and the sun. Seasons are actually caused by the 23.5 degree tilt of the Earth's axis.
- Arctic and Antarctic circles -- the place where sun can hit all day long
- Hottest months are July and August because the Sun progressively heats it up even after the summer solstice

### 4.3: Keeping Time
- Solar day: rotation period of Earth w.r.t. the Sun
- Sidereal day: defined in terms of rotation period of Earth w.r.t. stars
- **Why can't we just measure how much Earth rotates 'on its own'? **
- Apparent solar time: actual position of the Sun in the sky, given by sundials. 
- Mean solar time: average value of the solar day over the course of the year. 24 hours
- Standardization of time zones: noon is different for everyone
- Travelers reset watches only when time change accumulates to a full hour.
- New time zone ever 15 degrees longitude. 
- International Date Line: set at 180 degree meridian. By convention the date of the calendar is changed.

> To maintain our planet on a rational system of timekeeping, we simply must accept that the date will differ in different cities at the same time.

- What is time, really? Because I can't observe something happening in Japan at the same time. What is the rigorous way to understand 'at the same time'?

### 4.4: The Calendar
- Day (Earth), month (based on moon cycles), and year (Sun)
- Chinese: 12-year cycle of Jupyter, retained in the Zodiac

```
day, month, year, zodiac cycle
earth, moon, sun, jupiter
```

- Julian calendar: year as 365.25 days
- Julian calendar differs from the true year by about 11 minutes. Reformation by Pope Gregory XIII.
- Gregorian calendar: only century years divisible by 400 are leap years; also move the calendar forward 10 days. The average length of the Gregorian calendar is correct to 1 day in 3300 years
- Gregorian calendar was adopted immediately by catholic countries and later by other countries
- Russia did not abandon the Julian calendar until the Bolshevik revolution; Russians omitted 13 days to sync with the rest of the world.

### 4.5: Phases and Motions of the Moon
- The Moon glows from reflected sunlight
- The Moon follows phases
- The Sun moves 1/12 of its path around the sky every month
- How much of the face we see illuminated by sunlight depends on the angle the Sun makes with the Moon
- Moon -- new when it is between the sun and the Earth -- the moon is invisibile to us
- It takes 30 days for the moon to orbit the Earth
- lunacy -- lunar
- Sidereal month: 27.3217 days -- period of revolution about Earth measured wrt the stars.
- Moon rotates on its axis in the same time it takes to revolve around the earth; and so it always keeps the same face towards Earth. *Synchronous rotation*.
  - **Q:** This seems like too good of a coincidence to be true. Why?

### 4.6: Ocean Tides and the Moon
- The Earth is not perfectly rigid
- The moon exerts gravitational forces on the Earth
- Earth is an oblate spheroid
- Tide forces produce tidal bulges in the oceans; water gathers towards the moon.
- Neap tides: when the moon is in the 1st or last quarter, tides produced byt he sun partially cancel tides of the moon
- However, land masses stop the flow of water, the ocean has variable depth, etc.; so tides change a lot.

### 4.7: Eclipses of the Sun and Moon
- An object in the solar system casts a shadow when it blocks the light of the Sun
- Eclipse: any part of the earth or moon enters the shadow of the other
- Moon's shadow strikes earth: people in the shadow see the sun partially covered by the moon (solar eclipse)
- Earth passes into the shadow of earth: people in the night side of Earth see the moon darken (lunar eclipse)
- Umbra: cone where the shadow is darkest; penumbra: where the shadow is more diffuse
- A lunar eclipse is visible to everyone who can see the moon
- Even when eclipsed, the Moon appears red (why?) **Q**
- Corona: the thn outer atmosphere of the Sun visible during a total solar eclipse.

## Philosophical Relevance
Personal notes
- Ptolemization (reactionary) vs Copernican (revolutionary, new coordinates)
- Ptolemization requires an increasingly complex series of mecahnisms to accomodate reality
- Eratosthenes: measure the world with an angle (particularity to understand universality)
- Horoscopes: the arbitrariness of the scientific factors we choose to determine ourselves.
- Astronomists adopt the fictitious celestial sphere to literally define the coordinates of the sky.
- We need a star to measure and mark time
- Calendars: the necessity of time and the flacidity of skipping time
- Lunar eclipse: anyone who can see the moon can watch it be eclipsed by the ground they stand upon
