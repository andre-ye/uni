## Introduction
- Don Lemon and the relationship between white people and Trump.
- Argument: a view that has "seeped out" of sociology and ethnic studies departments into mainstream media outlets.
- Belief in a America as a white-supremacist state conferring power and privilege upon white people.
- Belief in the infection of racist institutions into all aspects of society through an interconnected network.
- Goal: transform the consciousness of Americans until race is prioritized over everything else.
- Trump's presidency was a gift to the MSM; but the 'woke moral panic' had begun at least five years before Trump entered the scene.
- 2011 - *New York Times* erected its online paywall, and articles mentioning 'racism', 'POC', 'slavery', 'oppression' began to appear more often in various news sources.
- Argument: primarily an issue of *class* rather than race. 
- Journalism has become a profession of privilege, turning from blue-collar trade to a highly-educated workforce.
- Radicalization of the profession on questions of identity: concern in economic inequality has declined.
- Journalists rising to the American elite and journalists mainstreaming radical ideas about race are "two sides of the same coin".
- Journalism has become an "impenetrable caste".
- Waging a cultural battle.
- Modern business model encourages building a niche audience.
- Economic and cultural divide, a chasm between the college educated and those the college educated disdain.
- For a culture war to succeed, it needs to be waged against a problem that can never be solved. Thomas Frank
- National liberal news media - mainstreaming a moral panic about the idea of race rather than issues of institutional racism.
- Rapacious economic inequality growing in America afflicting the working-class and poor people of all races.
- 'Wokeness' perpetuates the economic interests of affluent white liberals.
- Internally reconciling inequality: meritocratic status produces compassionate emotions towards the less fortunate. Perpetually on the right side of history without disrupting what was right for them. Panic around race: takes the guilt they *should feel* around their economic fortune and political power, and cast it on *whiteness* - an immutable characteristic they cannot change.
- Agitate for more diverse elites instead of a more equal society.
- Wokeness is the perfect ideology for affluent, liberal whites who don't want systemic change if it means their children must sacrifice their own status.
- American journalism comforts the comfortable.
- *Bad News* - a populist critique of American journalism.
- Racism as a cudgel to protect class interests.
- An 'optimistic' book - convinced it's not too late to change course.
- The liberal news media has abandoned the working class, allowing conservative outlets to swoop in and cater to them.

*Personal Comments and Thoughts for Discussion*
- Interesting discussion between desiring to believe and actually beliving. What are the epistemologically applications to Ungar-Sagon's claim here?
  - Quite a postmodern perspective
- What exactly is the difference between discussing the 'concept of race' vs. 'systemic racism'?
- What does Ungar-Sagon think about intersectional analysis of the black working class?

## Chapter 1: Joseph Pulitzer's Populist Revolution
- "It didn't have to be this way".
- American journalists responded to rampant inequality by making journalism a crusade on behalf of the powerless and economically disenfranchised.
- Benjamin Day: arrived in New York, deeply segregated. Brightness "only shown for few".
- The press was antilabor in 1829.
- *The Sun* - exists for everybody, rich and poor.
- Americans were the most literate people in teh world.
- News of crime - *the* local news of the poor and working classes.
- Penny press - visibility to people who weren't people of means.
- America's most important journalist: Joseph Pulitzer.
- Pulitzer was a Jewish immigrant from Hungary. Appaling Dickensian chasm between rich and poor in NYC when he arrived.
- Pulitzer was shaped by experiences at the bottom in a way he could not and did not wish to forget.
- Pulitzer exposed corruption and the abuses of the powerful against the powerless.
- Newspapers are a voice to speak out against the powerful.
- Pulitzer insisted on the truth.
- Penny press - a story about class. Partisanship is not so much of a problem so long as everyone is represented.

## Chapter 2: A Respectability Counterrevolution
- Not everyone was thrilled by the penny press revolution.
- Many labeled the newspapers crass, indecent, an affront to good taste.
- Pulitzer was accused of sensationalism.
- The *World* was the poor's world, even as the rich sneered.
- News is sensational - Pulitzer. Every story which is sensational in itself must also be truthful.
- Sensationalism is a class concern clothed as a journalistic critique - protection of the elites from reckoning with the realities of lower-class life.
- Henry Raymond began the *New York Times*.
- Whig magnates turned to Raymond and raised money to start a well-funded journal.
- Raymond placed borgeois respectability above all else.
  - Subtle rebuke to penny pressed.
- Proper and respectable; a monopoly on decency.
- Raymondw as known for being able to see both sides of an argument.
- The editorial page was kept weak.
- The bourgeois politics of respectability was popular with the target audience. Emphasized journalistic virtue.
- The *Times* was impartial on political issues but remained friendly to policies that benefitted their audience.
- Adolph Ochs, the successor; Jews were cast out during the Gilded Age.
  - Ochs wanted to be accepted. Obsessed with respectability.

> It will be my earnest aim that THE NEW-YORK TIMES give the news, all the news, in concise and attractive form, in language that is parliamentary in good society, and give it as early, if not earlier, than it can be learned through any other reliable medium; to give the news impartially, without fear or favor, regardless of party, sect, or interests involved; to make the columns of THE NEW-YORK TIMES a forum for the consideration of all questions of public importance, and to that end to invite intelligent discussion from all shades of opinion.

- Roadmap from class to taste to journalist virtue.
- Attractive language for good society and intelligent discussion.
- Marriage of class aspirations, signifiers of respectable taste, desire to avoid partisan identification.
- Fundamental tension between different visions of journalism
- Crafting elite readership
- Dynamics about audience, originality
- *The New Yorker* - not concerned with what poor and working-class New Yorkers were thinking about.
- Due to a status revolution among journalists, this is the rule rather than the exception.
