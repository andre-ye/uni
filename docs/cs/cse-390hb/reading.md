## Introduction
- Don Lemon and the relationship between white people and Trump.
- Argument: a view that has "seeped out" of sociology and ethnic studies departments into mainstream media outlets.
- Belief in a America as a white-supremacist state conferring power and privilege upon white people.
- Belief in the infection of racist institutions into all aspects of society through an interconnected network.
- Goal: transform the consciousness of Americans until race is prioritized over everything else.
- Trump's presidency was a gift to the MSM; but the 'woke moral panic' had begun at least five years before Trump entered the scene.
- 2011 - *New York Times* erected its online paywall, and articles mentioning 'racism', 'POC', 'slavery', 'oppression' began to appear more often in various news sources.
- Argument: primarily an issue of *class* rather than race. 
- Journalism has become a profession of privilege, turning from blue-collar trade to a highly-educated workforce.
- Radicalization of the profession on questions of identity: concern in economic inequality has declined.
- Journalists rising to the American elite and journalists mainstreaming radical ideas about race are "two sides of the same coin".
- Journalism has become an "impenetrable caste".
- Waging a cultural battle.
- Modern business model encourages building a niche audience.
- Economic and cultural divide, a chasm between the college educated and those the college educated disdain.
- For a culture war to succeed, it needs to be waged against a problem that can never be solved. Thomas Frank
- National liberal news media - mainstreaming a moral panic about the idea of race rather than issues of institutional racism.
- Rapacious economic inequality growing in America afflicting the working-class and poor people of all races.
- 'Wokeness' perpetuates the economic interests of affluent white liberals.
- Internally reconciling inequality: meritocratic status produces compassionate emotions towards the less fortunate. Perpetually on the right side of history without disrupting what was right for them. Panic around race: takes the guilt they *should feel* around their economic fortune and political power, and cast it on *whiteness* - an immutable characteristic they cannot change.
- Agitate for more diverse elites instead of a more equal society.
- Wokeness is the perfect ideology for affluent, liberal whites who don't want systemic change if it means their children must sacrifice their own status.
- American journalism comforts the comfortable.
- *Bad News* - a populist critique of American journalism.
- Racism as a cudgel to protect class interests.
- An 'optimistic' book - convinced it's not too late to change course.
- The liberal news media has abandoned the working class, allowing conservative outlets to swoop in and cater to them.

*Personal Comments and Thoughts for Discussion*
- Interesting discussion between desiring to believe and actually beliving. What are the epistemologically applications to Ungar-Sagon's claim here?
  - Quite a postmodern perspective
- What exactly is the difference between discussing the 'concept of race' vs. 'systemic racism'?
- What does Ungar-Sagon think about intersectional analysis of the black working class?

## Chapter 1: Joseph Pulitzer's Populist Revolution
- "It didn't have to be this way".
- American journalists responded to rampant inequality by making journalism a crusade on behalf of the powerless and economically disenfranchised.
- Benjamin Day: arrived in New York, deeply segregated. Brightness "only shown for few".
- The press was antilabor in 1829.
- *The Sun* - exists for everybody, rich and poor.
- Americans were the most literate people in teh world.
- News of crime - *the* local news of the poor and working classes.
- Penny press - visibility to people who weren't people of means.
- America's most important journalist: Joseph Pulitzer.
- Pulitzer was a Jewish immigrant from Hungary. Appaling Dickensian chasm between rich and poor in NYC when he arrived.
- Pulitzer was shaped by experiences at the bottom in a way he could not and did not wish to forget.
- Pulitzer exposed corruption and the abuses of the powerful against the powerless.
- Newspapers are a voice to speak out against the powerful.
- Pulitzer insisted on the truth.
- Penny press - a story about class. Partisanship is not so much of a problem so long as everyone is represented.

## Chapter 2: A Respectability Counterrevolution
- Not everyone was thrilled by the penny press revolution.
- Many labeled the newspapers crass, indecent, an affront to good taste.
- Pulitzer was accused of sensationalism.
- The *World* was the poor's world, even as the rich sneered.
- News is sensational - Pulitzer. Every story which is sensational in itself must also be truthful.
- Sensationalism is a class concern clothed as a journalistic critique - protection of the elites from reckoning with the realities of lower-class life.
- Henry Raymond began the *New York Times*.
- Whig magnates turned to Raymond and raised money to start a well-funded journal.
- Raymond placed borgeois respectability above all else.
  - Subtle rebuke to penny pressed.
- Proper and respectable; a monopoly on decency.
- Raymondw as known for being able to see both sides of an argument.
- The editorial page was kept weak.
- The bourgeois politics of respectability was popular with the target audience. Emphasized journalistic virtue.
- The *Times* was impartial on political issues but remained friendly to policies that benefitted their audience.
- Adolph Ochs, the successor; Jews were cast out during the Gilded Age.
  - Ochs wanted to be accepted. Obsessed with respectability.

> It will be my earnest aim that THE NEW-YORK TIMES give the news, all the news, in concise and attractive form, in language that is parliamentary in good society, and give it as early, if not earlier, than it can be learned through any other reliable medium; to give the news impartially, without fear or favor, regardless of party, sect, or interests involved; to make the columns of THE NEW-YORK TIMES a forum for the consideration of all questions of public importance, and to that end to invite intelligent discussion from all shades of opinion.

- Roadmap from class to taste to journalist virtue.
- Attractive language for good society and intelligent discussion.
- Marriage of class aspirations, signifiers of respectable taste, desire to avoid partisan identification.
- Fundamental tension between different visions of journalism
- Crafting elite readership
- Dynamics about audience, originality
- *The New Yorker* - not concerned with what poor and working-class New Yorkers were thinking about.
- Due to a status revolution among journalists, this is the rule rather than the exception.

## Chapter 3: A Status Revolution
- Until recently, journalists were not part of the American elite.
- Reporters regarded themselves as working-class.
- Status revolution - a degree was no longer a status symbol.
- College education became a marker of class in American society.
- The educational divide showed up quickly in politics.
- Class markers like travel, food, wine, and art
- New breed of reporter - highly educated and socially aspirational.
- By 1980, American journalists tightened into an elite caste.
- CHange in demographic breakdown; journalists were getting more liberal and less religious with every generation.
- Journalists at national news outlets are generally homogenou - cosmopolitan in background, liberal in outlook. Elite in economic status, public perception, and social influence.
- Reliance on initial middle to high class status in order to get into journalism.

## Chapter 4: The Abandoment of the Working Class
- *New York Times* - proclaimed the breakdown of a shared public reality built upon widely affected facts after Trump's election in 2016.
	- Yet, 91% of *New York Times* readers identify as Democrats.
- The real dichotomy is not political, but rather about class.
- Liberal news outlets began consciously excluding the poor and working class, opening the lane for conservative media to step in and clean up.
- The defining feature of conservative media is not that it endorses conservative politics, but rather that it picked up what the mainstream press abandoned in terms of the working class.
- In the 'Golden Age of Consensus', when Cronkite had become host of CBS news, the mainstream media was quickly abandoning the consensus approach 
- Consensus always took shape in the midst of a national crisis - unifies people around shared values.
- The 1940s to the 1960s were a time of buoyant social mobility.
- To keep a wide audience, publishers kept a premium on keeping the news straight; allowing readers to decide for themselves what events meant.
- FCC licenses - bound by the fairness doctrine.
- Journalism that was committed to the difference between opinion writing and straight news.
- Focus on the who, when, what, how - but not on the why.
- In the 1960s, the journalist class began to shift upwards. America was going through a knowledge explosion: the typical reader is "much better educated, his interests are more sophisticated..."
- Educational chasm that has defined American life today began to emerge; newspapers quickly chose a side.
- Topics that top executives wanted covered had much more to do with the reader's class rather than their political orientation.
- The big papers began poaching journalists from one another.
- The shift from analytic to interpretative began in 1954 and completed in 1974.
McCarthy's witch hunt gave the shift the justification it needed: reporters amplified his charges by reporting his accusations of communism.
- The shift drew some criticism from the left.
- The question of class predicted the liberal slant of most newspapers; "tnohign is a better predictor of liberlaism than whether or not you have been to college".
- Most young jounralists in 1970 simply did not believe in the notion of objectivity.
- Newspapers could not sell themselves tor eaders as a utility in 1964 when most Americans got their news from television.
- Obsession with white, well-off, upscale readers - newspapers began to expand into the suburbs rather than having anything to do with the working-class residents of their own cities.
- Little room for jounralists of color or catering to nonwhite communities from the perspective of the papers.
- A question of education and class that resulted in refusal to hire black jounalists.
- Effects on coverage:
	- Modern big-city newspapers became big businesses
	- Big publishers were unanimous in their support for the Republican Party.
- Five global firms own most of the newspapers.
- Massive collective shift from the Pulitzer model of seeking the widest mass audience possible to the Ochs model of seeking the most exclusive audience to court high-end advertisers.
- Consolidation meant chains, and chains meant publicly traded corporations that answered not just to readers and advertisers, but also to stockholders.
- Consumer oriented rather than citizen oriented.
- Newspapers often discriminated against groups that prejudiced clients didn't want to advertise to.
- Newspapers began to feed into an us-versus-them class divide mentality.
- Without a working-class readership, the liberal media has leaned more heavily on upper-class readers, viewers, and listeners.
- The political polarization exists, but the divide in class is more stark.
- Conservative media is conservative because it caters to the working class.
- Media outlets catering to the working class eschew the national for the local; there is a greater degree to which conservative values and localism overlap.
- Localism - valuing noncredentialled forms of meaning: place, faith, natural institutions
- The media is just as polarized along class lines as it is along political lines.
- Rush Limbauge portrayed the media as arrogant and out of touch. It was relatively easy to make mainstream emdia the bogeyman.
- Fox News could have created a real political constituency, but instead went all in on the culture wars.
- Conservative media does not have an accurate picture of who the working class is, either.
- The liberal media, on the other hand, has abandoned both sides of the cultural-economic equation.
- Fox News has sometimes descended into racism. Ailes constructed a never-ending us-versus-them saga; each news cycle feeds into a larger narrative.
- The concept of race has been ued to erase the role of class.
- No mainstream media outlet left does what Day and Pulitzer did: wage a crusade on behalf of the dignity and autonomy of the working class.

## Chapter 5: A Digital Revolution
- The Internet created information bubbles and echo chambers.
- The Internet had the opposite effect of democratization with regards to legacy journalism.
- The digital media is a perfect tool for elite journalists to drill down on subjects.
- The Internet has upended a top-down journalism of journalism.
- The cost of publication befcame near zero.
- The *Washington Post* drove readers to the website, algorithmically organized.
- A company can make money by tailoring its ads to specific class demographics.
- Engagement became key to collect data and show more ads.
- Digital ads always bring in a fraction of the money that print ads had. Major media outlets switched to digital subscriptions, then to memberships.
- Many new journalists have never gone out an reported a story; the incentive instead is to aggregate news from other places.
- The sole measure of a story's quality is how much the story is shared and talked about.
- This is *not* a democratization of the news. Less than a quarter of Americans use Twitter, and these users are younger, wealthier, and more educated than the nation at large.
- Journalists are increasingly foucsed on themselves.
- Vox: specific audience in mind - young, affluent, highly educated.
- Social media sharing as a digital magazine peeking out of a handbag.
- Quiet appeal to identity
- Takes the question of class and sells it as truth, information, and data - sells being informed as belonging to a certain class and having a certain identity.
