## Introduction
- Don Lemon and the relationship between white people and Trump.
- Argument: a view that has "seeped out" of sociology and ethnic studies departments into mainstream media outlets.
- Belief in a America as a white-supremacist state conferring power and privilege upon white people.
- Belief in the infection of racist institutions into all aspects of society through an interconnected network.
- Goal: transform the consciousness of Americans until race is prioritized over everything else.
- Trump's presidency was a gift to the MSM; but the 'woke moral panic' had begun at least five years before Trump entered the scene.
- 2011 - *New York Times* erected its online paywall, and articles mentioning 'racism', 'POC', 'slavery', 'oppression' began to appear more often in various news sources.
- Argument: primarily an issue of *class* rather than race. 
- Journalism has become a profession of privilege, turning from blue-collar trade to a highly-educated workforce.
- Radicalization of the profession on questions of identity: concern in economic inequality has declined.
- Journalists rising to the American elite and journalists mainstreaming radical ideas about race are "two sides of the same coin".
- Journalism has become an "impenetrable caste".
- Waging a cultural battle.
- Modern business model encourages building a niche audience.
- Economic and cultural divide, a chasm between the college educated and those the college educated disdain.
- For a culture war to succeed, it needs to be waged against a problem that can never be solved. Thomas Frank
- National liberal news media - mainstreaming a moral panic about the idea of race rather than issues of institutional racism.
- Rapacious economic inequality growing in America afflicting the working-class and poor people of all races.
- 'Wokeness' perpetuates the economic interests of affluent white liberals.
- Internally reconciling inequality: meritocratic status produces compassionate emotions towards the less fortunate. Perpetually on the right side of history without disrupting what was right for them. Panic around race: takes the guilt they *should feel* around their economic fortune and political power, and cast it on *whiteness* - an immutable characteristic they cannot change.
- Agitate for more diverse elites instead of a more equal society.
- Wokeness is the perfect ideology for affluent, liberal whites who don't want systemic change if it means their children must sacrifice their own status.
- American journalism comforts the comfortable.
- *Bad News* - a populist critique of American journalism.
- Racism as a cudgel to protect class interests.
- An 'optimistic' book - convinced it's not too late to change course.
- The liberal news media has abandoned the working class, allowing conservative outlets to swoop in and cater to them.

*Personal Comments and Thoughts for Discussion*
- Interesting discussion between desiring to believe and actually beliving. What are the epistemologically applications to Ungar-Sagon's claim here?
  - Quite a postmodern perspective
- What exactly is the difference between discussing the 'concept of race' vs. 'systemic racism'?
- What does Ungar-Sagon think about intersectional analysis of the black working class?

## Chapter 1: Joseph Pulitzer's Populist Revolution
- "It didn't have to be this way".
- American journalists responded to rampant inequality by making journalism a crusade on behalf of the powerless and economically disenfranchised.
- Benjamin Day: arrived in New York, deeply segregated. Brightness "only shown for few".
- The press was antilabor in 1829.
- *The Sun* - exists for everybody, rich and poor.
- Americans were the most literate people in teh world.
- News of crime - *the* local news of the poor and working classes.
- Penny press - visibility to people who weren't people of means.
- America's most important journalist: Joseph Pulitzer.
- Pulitzer was a Jewish immigrant from Hungary. Appaling Dickensian chasm between rich and poor in NYC when he arrived.
- Pulitzer was shaped by experiences at the bottom in a way he could not and did not wish to forget.
- Pulitzer exposed corruption and the abuses of the powerful against the powerless.
- Newspapers are a voice to speak out against the powerful.
- Pulitzer insisted on the truth.
- Penny press - a story about class. Partisanship is not so much of a problem so long as everyone is represented.
