## Week 2
Adminstrative
- Course will be graded 7/9 weeks participation.
- 4:30 to 6:20 on Thursdays in CSE2 371.
- [Course Website](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse143/22wi/honors.shtml){:target="_blank"}

Concepts
- *Computers*. A Turing Machine is a static machine that can perform very complex programs given the necessary symbols/instructions. However, it is not a computer. A *Universal Turing Machine* is a 'Turing Machine of Turing Machines' that contains a key property of computers: *programmability*. For this reason, a 4-function calculator is not a computer.
- *Meta-reasoning and meta-knowledge*. Humans are very good at reasoning on a meta- level, even though we may not completely understand our capacity for it. We can easily understand and build models for what others think about us, what others think about what we think about them, what other think about what we think about what they think about us, and so on. It may seem confusing when articulated in natural language, but these sorts of situations happen all the time in real life and in television/drama shows and we are able to understand it without friction.
- *Memes* - from Dawkins. Molecules in the primordial soup interact and compete in the replication competititon; they build survival apparatuses like cell membranes and become *survival machines*. Similarly, cultural phenomena and ideas engage in the replication game.
- *What defines a story?* A sequence or description of events (e.g. "I ate breakfast, I watched television, I worked") generally does not constitute a story. **The Reges Law**: every story must have a *meme*; this can be a moral (e.g. Aesop's fables). *Stories are the 'cell membrane'/survival machine mechanism of memes.*
- *Robert Frost and The Road Not Taken*: often read as a moral to take the path less trodden - *but neither path is more trodden than the other*. What is this a story of? Meta-dynamics, the human ego, our desire to wish things to be as we wish them to be and to invent a reason to support it, the longing of what the other road was.

## Week 3
- Concepts of race and class, prioritization/ranking of identity vs symbiosis/intersection of identity
- What makes humans unique? Passing down information from one generation to another
- Competition of memetic material
- Crossing of genetic evolution ('hardware', Turing machine) to memetic cultural evolution ('software', Universal Turing Machine).

## Week 4
- Developments in mathematics: Russell, Cantor, Godel, Turing
  - 1900 and the questions for the next century
  - The Continuity Problem
  - The Stability of Mathematics
- Cantor and the diagonalization argument, different sizes of infinity (countable vs uncountable sets)
- Understanding Reges' perspective in the Stanford drug incident
  - How should drug use be characterized and regulated?
- Interesting quasi-scandalous story of Reges, Peter Thiel, and homosexuality

## Week 5
- Race, class, and education
- Role of education in a new understanding of class (as opposed to traditional Marxist understandings)
- Reges' experience in education from Case Western to Stanford
- Godel's incompleteness theorem
- Turing and the Halting Problem
- Card trick
