## Week 1 Wednesday Lecture


### About CSE 142
- Learning Objectives
  - **Functionality/Behavior** - write functionally correct Java programs that meet a provided specification and/or solve a specified problem.
  - **Functional Decomposition** - break down problems into subproblems that are modular and reusable, and define methods to represent those subproblems.
  - **Control Structures** - select and apply control structures (e.g. methods, loops, conditionals) to manage the flow of control and information in programs.
  - **Data Abstraction** - select and apply basic data abstractions to manage and manipulate data in programs.
  - **Code Quality** - define programs that are well-written, readable, maintainable, and conform to established standards.
- 1/5 is about if the code works - it is not enough for the code to work. Code is for people, not computers. Code must be readable, well-written, and maintainable.

### Other Similar Courses

| Course | Attributes |
| --- | --- |
| CSE 142 | No programming and major in CS, CE, EE. |
| CSE 143 | Programming in Java before or AP CS in high school. |
| CSE 143x | You have programmed in a lanugage other than Java and are confident you can pick up new concepts. |
| CSE 160 | Interested in data science and analysis and learning Python over Java. |

### Course Components
- Lessons on MWF 11:30 in KNE; recordings will be released afterwards. First introduction to course concepts. Mix of content presentation and activity/problem practice. *There will be some required pre-work*.
- Sections on Thursday in various times. Led by TAs; held live in person and *not* recorded. Additional review, discussion, and practice; mostly practice problem. Double-check your MyUW again before section because rooms may change. Materials will be released after section.
- No attendance is taken; there is no need ot notify absences.

### Pedagogy
- You didn't learn how to ride a bike by being taught how to ride a bike.
- Learn by doing; do not expect to sit down and write code the first time successfully. Practice and expect failure.

### Learning in CSE 142
1. Exposure - lessons, video, textbook. Encounter concepts for the first time.
2. Guided practice - lesson activities, sections, labs. Practice with support from course staff.
3. Independent/Group Practice - checkpoints, section problems, additional practice.
4. Assessment - take-home assessments. Build upon steps 1-3 scaffolding, learn by doing and demonstrate mastery.
- Expect to practice, make mistakes, and do things more than once.
- Question-oriented.

## Week 1 Friday Lecture

### Java
- Programs begin with `public class`.
- All lower-case letters in keywords.
- Only allowed to use letters, numbers, underscores, and dollar signs.
- Conventions for this class - use pascal casing (e.g. `HelloWorld`, `ByeNow`).
- Program names must be descriptive.
- Use tabbing and indentation.
- `public stratic void main(String[] args)` - entry point, will use in the beginning of most every Java program.
- Command, method call - tells the program to do something.
- String - text, indicated by double quotes.
- Most lines in Java (statements) end w/ a semicolon.
- Methods - take a chunk of code and give it a name. Adds structure to the code and allows for repeated code to be called easily.
- Method names **begin with a lower letter**, whereas program names **begin with an upper letter**.

### Assessment and Grading
- The goal of the course is to master the concepts and skills being taught.
- Work assessments are a proxy for mastery, and the final grade should reflect the extent to which you have demonstrated course objective mastery.
- Take-home assessments (weekly, 8), checkpoints (checkpoints, 9-10), culminating assessments (2), reflections (8-10)
