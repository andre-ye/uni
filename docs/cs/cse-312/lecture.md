## Week 1 Monday -- Introduction and Counting
- May 3rd evening exam
- 312 is intro to statistics and probability theory
- Useful and interesting branch of mathematics
- Probability as frequency: $$X / (X + \neg X)$$.
- Set -- unordered list of elements ignoring repeats.
- Sum rule -- cardinality of union of two non intersecting sets is the sum of the cardinalities of each set
- A nontemporal definition of combinatorics via product of elements?
- Product rule: if you have a sequential process in which step $$k$$ has $$n_k$$ options, the totla number of possibilities is $$n_1 \cdot n_2 \cdot \hdots \cdot n_k$$
  - This is taking the Cartesian product of the relevant sets.
- Cardinality of a powerset is two to the cardinality of the original set
  - How to generate this?
  - For every element of the original set we can either include it or not include it -- this gives us the formula
- Complementary counting
