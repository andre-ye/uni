## Week 1 Wednesday - Introduction, Binary and Hex
- Why do we have powerful machines and how can they run a wide variety of software?
- The goal of the course is to present key abstractions under the hood. 
- Layers of computing: software applications (14x, 331, 332), programming languages and libraries (341), operating systems (451), hardware. 351 is between operating systems and hardware: the HW/SW interface.
- Topic groups:
  1. Data - memory, data, integers, arrays, structures, etc.
  2. Programs - x86-64 assembly, procedures, stacks, executables
  3. Scale and Coherence - cahces, processes, virtual memory, memory allocation
- Grading
  - Pre-lecture - for completion
  - Homework - unlimited submission attempts
  - Labs - graded for correctness
  - Exams - midterm and final, take-home, individual
  - EPA - effort, participation, altruism.
- Get machine access to the CSE Linux environment (SSH into attu for CSE majors) ASAP.
- Relationship between binary and hex: every digit in hex corresponds to a four-length binary string. 
- Computers compute generally in base 2.
- We need to agree on an encoding - equivalent representation of numbers. 
- With $$n$$ binary digits, you can represent $$2^n$$ things.
- Binary digit - a bit. A hex digit (4 bits) - nibble. Two hex digits (8 bits) - byte.
