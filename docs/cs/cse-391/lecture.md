## Week 2
- Most of the tools will be in Linux and *nix systmes.
- Knowing that tools exist can help you navigate projects. 
- Unix - initially developed in 1970 at Bell Labs; many of these key ideas are still used today.
  - Everything is a file
  - Hierarchical file systems
  - Multiple users
  - Input / output streams
- macOS is a disguised unix OS.
- Linux vs Shell - shell is an interactive program which allows the user to interact with the operating system.
- Why use shells over GUIs?
  - Complicated tasks are easier on the command line
  - Useful for remote servers
  - Programmable
  - Customizable
- Bash shell will be used in this class, but there are many others.
- One dot - current directory. Two dots - parent directory.
- `/query` to search, press `n` to keep going.
- `-a` will show hidden files - things starting with a dot.
- `touch` will create a file.
