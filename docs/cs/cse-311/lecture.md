## Week 1 Wednesday
- Syntax - words and rules for combinations of words
- Proposition - a statement that has a truth value and is well-formed.
- Can propositions have a truth value if they exceed the limits of human knowledge? Prof says yes, but maybe not...
- We want to talk about arbitrary ideas, so we use propositional variables. Lower-case letters, starting from $$p$$ for proposition.
- Logical connectives: $$\wedge$$ (and), $$\vee$$ (or), $$\neg$$ (not)
- Implications: $$p \to q$$. $$\neg(p \wedge \neg q)$$.
- Implication as a promise: can you demonstrate that I am lying / not holding the promise?
- $$p\to q$$ is not equivalent to $$q \to p$$: $$\to$$ is not a commutative operator.
