## *Kennedy and the Promise of the Sixties*, Rorabaugh
### Introduction
- The early 60s were a time of promise and optimism: science, wealth, technology, improving life
- A society balancing between fulfilling and making promises: getting hooked on promises
- When hope gets too far ahead of experience, this difference kills hope
- Desire and reason: did desire govern more?
- Dark undercurrents: eroding tradition, difficulties in gender and sexuality -- an insistence on promising. Let's ride on the surface!
  - Contradiction between phenomena and noumean explored in music
  - Tension between public and private
  - Collapse of censorship and rising counterculture; coarsening of discourse
  - Postmodernity
- Why should we look at the 60s?
  - Complex interactions between the political, social, and culture
  - These interactions became in excess of themselves: liberation of the self from social constraints
  - The 60s are a crucial formative period in American politics
- 60s as a change in tone from the conservatism of the 50s -- a move from the complacent and comformist to the radical
- Kennedy: mastery of the television but failure to do much as president; cautious but bold; a president of spectacle. 


### Chapter 1: Kennedy
- The 1960s and John Kennedy have a very close relationship with each other
- Americans already sensed they were entering a promising time leading up to the start of the 60s
- The 50s as the Great Barbecue
  - Criticism of Eisenhower as lethargic, a do-nothing.
  - Vapidity of consumerism
  - Not everyone can enjoy the great barbecue
- McCarthy's anti-communist smears of the 50s form an intellectual vacuum
- Eisenhower as a master of deception; ruthless government across the world. 
- Nixon becomes Eisenhower's VP, but not a good candidate: widely hated. A 'middle class uneducated swindler' without moral compass
- Kennedy declares for presidency in January 2, 1960 -- opening oft the decade. Projected forwards unrelenting optimism
- Turned youth into an advantage
- Kennedy's family was very important
- Jack was a war hero; stranded on island and survived by sending a coconut message
- Suspicious relationship with McCarthy
- Question of being Catholic: can a Catholic be allected?
- Remaking of American politics, almost populist: appealing directly to voters, grassroots campaigning
- Rise of data-driven, strategic, careerized politicking 
- Kennedy suffered from chronic poor health, which he hid
- Kennedy's personal relationship was scandalous and tenuous
- Kennedy grew coalitional support in very complex and tense ways, almost surpassing logic
- Strategic action with Civil Rights leaders to get a larger share of the Black vote
- Wins very narrowly
- Inaugural address: ignores domestic affairs, very global and international -- reframes the role of the citizen and the government
- Reshaping of the aides: smart and intellectual (a source of criticism, detached from common sense); egalitarian and chaotic; creative but poor coordination.
- A liberal fantasy paradise for three months, interrupted by the Bay of Pigs invasion.

## Document Collection #1
### "A Frightening Message for a Thanksgiving Issue"
- Increasing fear of the possibility of mutual nuclear war after the US was no longer the sole possessor of atomic reapons
- Preparing the public for a nuclear attack -- Americans, you can survive without protective clothing or special training!
- An immanent contradiction here: fear the bomb, but also you will be fine.

> Very likely you won't finish this article, because it's about death.

- *Civil* defense
- Ultimate death and destruction resulting from the bomb
- The eternal proliferation of the cloud: radioactivity, the 'undead' coming to drag you towards death.
- Individualization -- you must save yourself, death confronts us all as individuals.
- But where to go with your family? You need a thick cellar to store and save yourself.
- Tensions between the individual and the collective
- Shelter -- what ideological, philosophical, political significance can we read in this?

### Incoming Telegram, Kennan
1: Basic Features of the Post-War Soviet Outlook
- USSR lives in "antagonistic 'capitalist encirclement'"
- Stalin: a socialist and capitalist center in the word order
- The capitalist word is beset with inherent antagonisms which cannot be resolved peacefully, esp. between England and the US
- War is endemic to capitalism
- Intervention against the USSR would delay Soviet socialism
- Capitalism is not unilaterally bad -- qua Marx, it produces conditions of enlightenment
- Moderate-socialist, socialist-democratic leaders -- Lenin's false friends of the people: these are the most dangerous elements of bourgeois-capitalist society.
- **The above premises** imply therefore that capitalism must be weakened, Soviet efforts should be directed at maximizing tensions between capitalist nations, and socialism abroad should be put down.
- To clarify, here Kennan is observing the Soviet point of view.

2: Background of Outlook
- Part 1 does not represent the "natural outlook of the Russian people" -- Russians are generally eager to reap the fruits of bourgeois-capitalist society.
- Premises in part 1 are not true: socialism as backwardsness; war is not endemic to capitalism; 'insanity' of doubting the good naturedness of moderate socialism. Falseness demonstrated -- how? empirically perhaps?
- Soviet propaganda is not "objective", but comes from a "neurotic view of the world" -- linked with the "traditional" Russian "insecurity". The West as more competent and powerful. Russians as motivated by a stupid defense of backwardsness and archaicity.
- Marxist dogma: becomes the theoretical vehicle for insecurity, a 'sacrifice of ethics' (Zizek: behind every genocide there is a poet). 
- Russian nationalism smuggled under international Marxism: ignorance, mental dependence to the point of castration. Lack of access to "unbiased" information. **Oriental secretiveness**. 
- Is there a certain kind of racialization going on here?
- Disrespect for objective truth

3: Projection of Soviet Outlook in Practical Policy on Official Level
- Soviet policy has a 'visible' and 'invisible' (subterranean) dimension
- Participation in international organizations (Jewry? Is there a connection here -- conspiracy? Semitism -- Zizek, the figure of the Jew who embodies the ultimate contradiction needed to maintain the appearance of the ontological consistency of a theory)
- Strategic alliances and conquering to embolden the Soviet state
- Participation in colonization of conquered people -- this is interesting.
- Base and superstructure, qua Marx: economic reform and the ideological, legal, militaristic components

4: The Unconscious Subterranean Plane
- Underground operating of world communism
- Many associations in the US such as women's organizations, labor unions, racial societies, etc. can be "dominated or influenced by such penetration"
- Is there a Freudian perspective we can think about?
- Religion and pan-Slavic movements -- this is an interesting complicating factor. Precisely the ability to overcome differences is what endows the Soviet spirit with its omniscient power?
- Encouragement of violence, and a violent synthesis of a dialectical contradiction -- black and white (!!!), poro and rich, young and old, etc. This is the critical mediating (disrupting?) element which completes the triad, which moves from two to three
- Manipulate influence on colonized peoples, weaken colonial policy.
- Communists will destroy personal liberty and freedom
- Setting Western Powers against each other -- more dialectical enforcement
- Soviet regime as a 'police regime'

5: Practical Deductions for US Policy
- Fanatical commitment to destroying the US and the American way of life.
- Borne from a deep Russian nationalism
- Soviet power is a logic of force -- almost physical, brunt.
- Soviets are still weaker!
- Soviet system still may not work! After Stalin's death.
- Soviet propaganda can be easily beaten!
- Placement of the US nto a position of universality via commimtent to objectivity and detachment -- movement outside of a fanatic particularity
- 'Educate' the public on the Russian situation. In fact the obejctive is not to breed rampant anti-Sovietism but to do so rationally, to claim the appearance of rationality. This is interesting now. What kind of engendering is being done upon the Soviets here?
- The courage to cling to 'our conceptions' of human society -- do not cope, do not allow the parasite to take over.
- Interesting ideological analysis which can be done on this work -- contradictions and tensions abound.

### Kitchen Debates, 1959
- Nixon and Khrushchev -- at the US Embassy in Moscow
- Nixon showing kitchen to Khrushchev.
- The kitchen is equipped with appliances to make women's lives easier -- Khrushchev says that this 'capitalist attitude' towards women does not occur under Communism. 
- Universalization of the domestication of women -- making life easier
- Differences of temporality -- what goes out of date and what doesn't?
- What is the Soviet man? Not quite so backwards as in the American imagination...
- Who is the slave? who has freedom?
- Free exchange and free ideas -- but what is the critical particular edge to universalizing free exchange?
- Battle of progresion -- who will go further?
- The question of translation and mutual understanding

### Montgomery Bus Boycott Threat, 1954
- *Women's* political council
- Mediocre reform: black people sit from back to front, and white people from front to back
- Patronization of buses by black people

### Brown v. Board of Education, 1954
- 14th amendment invoked -- separation of white and black children in public schools on the basis of race
- Segregation deprives minority children of equal opportunity even if 'tangible' factors are equal
- Separate but equal in Plessy v. Ferguson cannot continue
- Segregated public schools can never be equal; they are deprived of equal protection
  - Beyond differential outcomes: what would be wrong about separate but equal but *truly* equal, assuming this is hypothetically possible? Or is this a false question?
- Removal of legal distinctions?
- Equalization of 'tangible' factors -- the decision cannot turn on a comparison of the material consequential outcomes, but rather the effect of *segregation itself* (yes! my previous question)
- Education is an important governmental function, and it is important for a democratic society. Education is a right.
- Does segregation of children on race deprive minority children of equal educational opportunities? SC opinion: it does.
  - Generation of feelings of inferiority, which impedes learning
  - Appeal to psychological finding
  - Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal (can this be applied to other dimensions which we feel are more acceptable?)

### Birmingham Public Accommodation Segregation Laws
- Unlawful for control of any area in which both black and white people are allowed with equal geophysical relation
- White and nonwhite people must be separated in different rooms or by a partition in restaurant
- A black and white person *cannot play together*
- Equal but separate accomodation for black and white people
- Take the seat to which you *belong*
- Interesting geopolitical divide of space: and why? Maybe it is a naive question: but why this doctrine of separate but equal? Why spatial demarcation?

### Southern Manifesto, 1956
- Supreme Court involvement in segregation cases -- "substitute naked power for established law"
- Appeal to Founding Fathers, legal conservatism, overstepping of the Constitution, abuse of judicial power
- "Climaxes a trend" in the judiciary branch to legislate -- increasing 'politicization' of the court?
- Constitution does not mention education
  - Essentially a shallow and strict textualist reading
- Argument that the 14th amendment odes not conflict with the doctrine of separate but equal
- Appeal to the right of parents to direct their children's education
  - What is wrong about this?
  - Maybe we should dismantle the parental instinct.
- The court ruling is "destroying amicable relations" -- a vision of a fall from purity, now suspicion and hatred
- "outside meddlers"
- Some states declared resistance to forced integration
- No appeal at all to the actual separate but equal law -- instead an appeal to the protection of racial discrimination under the Constitution, or at least the lack of objection to it which can be found in the Constitution

## Document Collection #2

### *The Dependence Effect*, from *The Affluent Society* (Galbraith)
- The idea that wants apply unilaterally across indiviudals' conditions is repugnant to common sense
- The case for the urgency of production based on the urgency of wants has no ground: one cannot defend production as satisfying wants if it creates those wants (pharmakon)
- Production only fills a void that it has itself created
- Consumer wants can be bizarre and frivolous. It is almost admirable if a society still desires to satisfy them. But it is like a hamster running in a wheel: satisfaction creates desire.
- Keynes: the middle class has insatiable desires
- People become evaluated by the types of products they have. 
- Direct link between production and wants in modern advertising and salesmanship: the central function is to create desires.
- Advertising is a large cost -- increasing growth of the modern advertising industry
- Wants are dependent on production -- the producer both makes the goods and the desires for them
- Economists resist this concept: closed their eyes to obtrusive phenomena -- the want creation.
- Advertising has an uneasy place in economic theory
- Notion of independently determined wants and still dominates textbooks -- and the economist dedicates himsefl towards fulfilling these wants.
- **As a society becomes increasingly affluent, wants are increasingly created by the process by which they are satisfied.**
- It is no longer necessarily true that welfare is greater at a higher level of production than at a lower one -- it may be the same. This is the Dependence Effect.

> Like woman's, his work is never done.

- The squirrel wheel is not structurally faultless: there are structural weaknesses.

> It is easy to see why the conventional wisdom resists so stoutly such change. It is far, far, better and much safer to have a firm anchor in nonsense than to put out on the troubled seas of thought.

### The Sharon Statement (1960), YAF
- Responsibility of young (conservative) America to 'affirm certain truths'
- Individual's use of God-given free will
- Political freedom is dependent on economic freedom
- The government exists to protect economic freedoms
- The government becomes tyrannical past these existential requirements
- Supremacy and omniscience of the Constitution
- States' rights
- The market economy is the single best economy
- Communism is the single greatest threat to these liberties
- The US should stress *victory over coexistence* with the 'menace' of Communism -- the US should pursue a world in alignment with its vision for it.
- A militant and interventionist global policy

### VP Nixon on Foreign Policy, 1960
- "Name one Republican President whot ook us into war"
- Not a question of Republican or Democrat, but of America
- What will keep the peace?
- Eisenhower has never acted in haste or anger, always calm and bold in the face of 'dictators' like Khurshchev
- 'Pipsqueak' Castro -- why can't we send the Marines in? The people of Cuba will 'take care of it' if the US morally supports them.
- Kennedy is a flop: sometimes here, sometimes there
- 'only an inexperienced and impulsive act could lead to war'
- Not military or economic strength but rather a question of honor and moral strength.

> The question is: Do you take a chance or do you go forward on the kind of policies that Dwight Eisenhower has given the United States? And I say we go forward.

- Resting upon Eisenhower's stability and cool-headedness
- "Forget" -- party label, family votes, etc. -- vote for America and the world.

### Eisenhower Farewell Address, 1961
- Four major wars among great nations in the 20th century (which ones?)
- American exceptionalism -- depend upon judicial and virtuous use of American power
- Purpose -- to foster peace and human achievement
- There will continue to be more crisis
- To balance the private and the public economy
- New threats are constantly arising
- A strong military presence is now an integral part of America, and this necessary; but we should be wary of the military-industry complex
  - An alert and knowledgeable citizenry necessary
- Avoid the impulse to live only for today -- conserve and sustain, do not plunder
- A confederation of equals

### John F. Kennedy Inaugural Speech, 1961
- The world is different now -- man holds the power to abolish poverty and life itself.
- We must be united to confront challenges
- Freedom and decolonization
- Effort to help the rest of the world -- it is right, a free society must help the many who are poor
- Hope in the UN as an international regulatory body
- Hope for peace in the face of possible darkness; never fear to negotiate
- To turn science for us, to explore the unexplored, and to encourage liberal heaven.

> And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you -- ask what you can do for your country.  My fellow citizens of the world: ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man. 

- Appeal to a certain Protestant work ethic -- fulfill your dity

### Kennedy's Consumer Bill of Rights, 1962
- Uneffective organization by consumers, despite their large nature.
- Cannot afford waste in consumption; the dollar should be spent best
- Technology increases the difficulties of the consumer; law is too old.
- Marketing becomes impersonal
- Right to
  - Safety
  - To be informed
  - To choose
  - To be heard

### Kennedy at American University, 1963
- Wilson: a university graduate should be a man of his nation as well as a man of his time
- Few things more beautiful than a university: a striving to know
- What is peace? Not peace contingent on suffering -- genuine peace -- not only for Americans but for all mena dn women
- New war threats -- but war is irrational 
- War as the 'necessary rational end of rational men'
- We must examine our own attitudes -- look inwards, not just outwards.
- Too many of us think that peace is impossible -- but it is defeatist. Problems are manmade.
- Conflict does not last forever. 
- We msut persevere: peace does not need to be impracticle; and war does not need to be inevitable. We can 'break' history.
- Sad to realize the gulf between the Soviets and the Americans -- but it is a warning, to not distort your view
- No government is so evil that people might be considered to lack virtue; but the Russian people should still be 'hailed' for their achievements.
- Never been at war with the Soviet Union
- Why devote money to armment when you could to combating 'ignorance, poverty, disease'?
- Halting the arms race
- Let us not be blind to our differences, but also emphasize our commonalities
- We are not engaged in a debate --the world as it is now.
- American weapons are deterrent
- Strengthen the United Nations
- Keeping peace in the non-Communist world
- Maintaining alliances
- Blaming change on the Communist imperialist drive
- Outlawing of nuclear tests
- What is the domestic attitude towards peace and freedom? We have responsibilities to pursue: to respect the rights of all others and to respect law.
- Safeguard human intersts above national interests
- "The US, as the world knows, will never start a war. We do not want war." Ironic words

## Document Collection #3

### "Developing Community Leadership", Ella Baker
- Ella Baker -- works in early 1940 with the NAACP as an assistant field secretary; becomes a national director of branches eventually
- Participant in SNCC after SCLC
- Not making a contribution -- functioning where you need to function
- In the south, NAACP membership could get you killed
- Routinely travel to the South to organize membership campaigns
- Local problems necessitate organization with /in the NAACP
- Interesting point on individuals and how to understand their own place:

> My basic sense of it has always been to get people to understand that in the long run they themselves are the only protection they have against violence or injustice... People have to be made to understand that they cannot look for salvation anywhere but to themselves.

- Problem of *de facto* segregation -- achievement levels of black people go down instead of up when they enter public school
- People who cntrol things -- no belief that they will pay the price of itnegration
- Not insisting on a title at the SCLC
- SNCC born out of conference in 1960
- SUpporting role -- do it for the young people. No difficulty relating to young people.
- No paid relationship with SNCC
- It is a handicap for oppressed peoples to depend so much on a leader -- a leader is a leader because they have been recognized as such by media institutions, etc. 
- Movement of the fifties and sixties -- carried much by women from church groups; women as a supportive role; Black women carrying this role. Younger women insisting on equal footing
- What is important is not so much people being interested in leaders as developing leadership

### *Ecology and Revolutionary Thought*, Murray Bookchin (1964)
- Every development of revolutionary thought grows in parallel with a branch of science
  - Copernicus and Gaileo -- rationalism and naturalism
  - Mechanics and mathematics -- Enlightenment
  - Biology and anthropology -- overthrow of the Victorian era
  - Freudian psychology -- Marx
- Growth of psychology
- Modern science has lost its 'critical edge', its 'liberatory estate', but there is a savior: ecology, relation between the animal and its spheres; the balance of nature

The Critical Nature of Ecology
- Critical edge of ecology comes from man's sovereignty over man and his activities
- Human parasitism
- Imperialism and the despoliation of the environment: CO2 emissions, pollution of watewrways, , etc.
- Man as a highly destructive parasite -- sure. But this reflects a disruption in the ecological situation. And this is of the 'social ecology'
- Organization into extreme belts and industrialized, swollen apparatuses
- The question of the ecological 'breaking point'
- SImplification of the environment -- encroachment of the synthetic on the natural: the cultural dimension of manipulation and ideological influence
  - Quantiative, statistical abstraction over free expression and complexity
  - A false claim, I might propose, in that the great contradiction is that these are held together
- Reformulation and mechanization of agriculture as a machine to be optimized: flat landscapes
- Division of labor, to an exaggerated point -- natural beauty sacrificed by cold concrete -- *undoing of organic evolution* (really?) -- eliminating local difference
- Ecology has a necessarily social dimension (I don't know how much this applies only to ecology...)

The Reconstructive Nature of Ecology
- Attempts to resolve contradictions of centralization and stratification -- "progress".
- Anarchist: social outcast, false dreams for decentralization and humanism
- History validates anarchist thought
- Balanced community, face-to-face democracy, decentralized society, humanistic technology -- not just dreams, but necessary
  - 'Intuiting', a feeling, of anarchism among the youth
  - A reaction against modern instituted comformity
- Ecology redirects nihilist rejection of centralization to an affirmation of life and a humanistic society: **diversity** -- balance and harmony, respect of the web of dependence. More room for spontaneity, biological forces
- A deindustrialization or postindustrialization of agirculture and land: descaling
- Nuclear fuels -- not 'ecological' -- first apply ecological principles, do not try to engage in technological determinism & progressivism. Rather a localized method of energy sources. Highlight local potentialities
- We need a new kind of geopolitics, a new kind of relating and community
- Decentralization: logistical problems cannot be solved top-down
  - What is the border between anarchism and laissez-faire capitalist libertarianism? Perhaps the latter still retains the state structure necessarily
  - Diminishing variety in the natural world destroys its harmony and unity
  - Man is certainly of nature: social ecology
  - Unity by differentiation
- The anarchist seeks to elaborate and express possible social experience
- Electronic devices should be used little to mediate relations between people -- all members should have contribution for collective decisions -- we must humanize humanity
- General education 
- Rotation of responsibilities -- self-development and generality

Observations on "Classical Anarchism" and Modern Ecology
- Anarchism must apply basic libertarianism to new historical principles
- In revolution there is concentration 
- Is anarchism 'classical'?
- Anarchists must grasp changing historicity in the backdrop of static libertarian principles
- The anarchist finds themselves:
  - Post French revolution
  - Industrial proletariat
  - Now -- widespread peasant discontent and undermining by modern technology
- "astonishing social mobility and insecurity" -- "virutal impossibility to predict the ovcational or professional future of most people int he Western world"
- Technology is ripe with the promise for liberated society. Anarchism ust assimilate it in humanistic terms. Anarchism must infuse modern technology with an organic dimension.
- SOcial disintegration under capitalism and after capitalism: can anarchism update itself?

### "Homophile Groups Argue Civil Liberties", The Washington Post (1964)
- "second largest minority group in the US"
- Equality of job rights for gay people
- Government policy of dismissing creates pressure points for blackmail
- Increasing public attention to gay people
- Rep. John Dowdy (D) of Texas
- The gay person is 'the same as any other person'except for their sexual orientation
- Removal of criminal sanctions for sexual acts in private

### Letter from Birmingham City Jail, MLK Jr. (1963)

### "The Sexual Sell", Friedan
- The image of women as housewives
- "Why do people in books never go to the toilet?"
- Women as housewives: to buy more things for the house. Women are chief customers of American business.
- Not necessarily a conspiratorial, but -- by materialist analysis -- the outcome of economic objectives
- "sexually joyless, uncreative, purposeless lives" of American housewives
- American housewives can find identity in consumerism
- Market segmentation
  - The "True Housewife" -- too dedicated to housework, will not accept new consumer products
  - Career women are too critical 
  - The Balanced Homework is the ideal type -- readily accepts mechanical appliances but has outside interests
- Be a modern housewife!
- Advertisers as manipulators -- social science and advertising, the sinister dimension of psychology
- Must emphasize creative effort
- Products aren't just selling products -- selling happiness and images, and selling personal narratives
- MId-50s: the Career Woman is gone -- finds in housework an expression of femininity and individuality
- "Creativeness is the modern woman's dialectical anser to the problem of her changed position in the houehold. Thesis: I'm a housewife. Antithesis: I hate drudgery. Synthesis: I'm creative!"
- House cleaning should be fun: achievement, granting of the ego
- Participation of women in the enterprise of science?
- The *illusion* of achievement
- Possibly an algorithamitization of women? 
- Teenagers and young wives -- insecure - convince the youth that happiness through things is entirely possible
- Market reports, surveys
- The remaking of consumerist femininity
- A need to advance in life -- satisfied in the capitalist incorporative method
- "If the stores are women's school of life, ads are the textbooks"
- Privacy and individualism: personalization
- Where is the missing sexual spark?  -- consumerism sexed the sex out of sex. So how to return the libido?
- The need to develop the need for new products (Galbraith)
- The complexity of feminine consumerism
- NOt the creation of the feminine mystique -- but certainly perpetuation -- flattering and reifiying the image of the American housewife. **And all with the assistance of social science.**
- The housewife as an 'unaware victim'
 - The attempt to 'get them young' -- to put womanhood and wifery upon young girls immediately.
  - This is wrong, certainly. But what is wrong about it? NOt the 'virginal purity' of young girls.
  - "grooming"
  - "sacrifice our girls"
- Ignorance of women's intelligence and energy
- A sick and/or immature society? Retreating into "that thing-ridden house"
  - "thing-ridden house" -- the epotime of American consumerism

### Port Huron Statement, SDS (1962)
- 'Bred in at least modern comfort, housed now in universities, looking uncomfortably to the world we inherit'
- Increasingly troubling developments of modernity; paradoxes and concerns in American society -- hypocrisy and contradiction abound
- May be the last generation of living
- There is an alternative, a democratic alternative 
- Campus -- a place of private people, going as usual. Students leave university fundametnally unchallenged in values and political orientations. Education's real function is to impart complacency and comfortableness
- The campus is a miniature of America -- isolation of the individual, democracy without publics; a psychological conflict
- Politics without publics: the American political system confuses individual citizens
- We celebrate economic prosperity amid poverty and deprivation -- the affluent society. Work is unfulfilling -- the wastes of consumerist society, the entrepreneur of the self
- Eisenhower's military-industrial complex: the permanent war economy
- Towards American democracy
  - Abolish political stalemate
  - Politicize youth and sociality
  - No institutions to sifle dissent; peaceful dissent
  - Coporations must be publicly responsible
  - Fair distribution fo resources
  - America should concentrate on 'real' social proprities

### Letter from Birmingham Jail, MLK Jr. (1963)
- In Birmingham city jail: clergymen have called activities 'unwise and untimely'
- Does not pause to answer criticism often -- there is too much
- SCLC: large organization, resources are shared. Invited to Birmingham to engage in nonviolent direct programs.
- Interrelatedness of communities and states -- there is no 'foreign' when it comes to justice: "justice aywhere is a threat to justice everywhere"
- Look not only at the effecs but also the causes
- 4 steps of nonviolent campaign
  1. Collection of facts
  2. Negotiation
  3. Self purification
  4. Direct action
- Birmingham -- most thoroughly segregated US city; brutal treatmetn of black people
- Treaties and promises don't work.
- Why sit ins and marches? Why not negotiation? Direct action creates the conditions and tensions to force negotiation -- "dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored"
- The nonviolent register must have the dimension of tension -- not violent tension, but nonviolent tension
  - Socrates -- tension in the mindof individuals to see the objective world
  - Monologue over dialogue -- too long
- 'Untimely acts'. The administration must be prodded -- a segregationist is a segregation.
- "History is the long and tragic story of the fact that privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily"
- "Wait!" the Althusserian policeman -- Wait too often means Never for the Black man
- Inspiration from African and Asian postcolonization
- poverty in an/the affluent society
- What is the breaking of laws? Some laws are just, some are unjust. Augustine: an unjust law is no law at all
  - A just law -- 'squares with moral law or the law of God'; a law must uplift human personality and not degrade it
  - Segregation substitutes "I-it" with "I-thou"
  - Not democratic
  - An ordinance enforced to promote segregation is unjust
  - Not breaking laws willy nilly -- "that would lead to anarchy"
  - We must break unjust laws openly and novingly, and to willingly accept the penalty
  - Not unique: early Christians, academic freedom and Socrates
- Everything Hitler did in Germany was "legal" -- but here is a higher law
- Grave dissapointment with the white moderate -- the greatest stumbling block is the white moderate devoted to order over justice, preference for 'negative peace': paternalism
- Tension in the South is a necessary phase of transition from obnovious negative peace towards positive peace
- Nonviolent actors are not creators of tension, but in fact birng to the surface the tension which already exists
- Society must protect the robbed and punish the robber
- "The teachings of Christ take time" -- time is in fact entural, there is no progressive determinism which guides things somehow: human progress never rolls on the wheels of inevitaiblity
- Two opposing forces in the Black community: complacents and bitters (Black nationalist groups)
- Oppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever: freedom will come (tension between making history and history being made): cosmic urgency towards the promised land of racial justice
- 'facts of history'
- "I gradually gained a bit of satisfaction from being considered an extremist" -- Jesus, Paul, Martin Luther, John Bunyan -- all extrimists. What kind of extremist will we be?
- Disappointment in the white church and its leadership
- Law vs moral right
- "What kind of people worship here? Who is their God?"
- Churh as thermometer vs Churh as thermostat
- The goal of America is freedom
- "Your statement has troubled me profoundly"
- Nonviolence in the favor of violent ends is violent

  - Communists quickly abandoned the black cause when war broke out
- If you don't begin with peace, you won't end with it -- A.J. Musty

- The 'drug of integration' -- never fighting for integration, but rather against white supremacy
- A man is born free -- it is not a question of white people *giving* black people freedom. In fact the onus is on the white man to *stop denying black people their freedom*. (i.e. relocating responsibility from the black man to the white man)

- War in Vietnam is illegal and immoral -- but who/what is the higher law for?

- Camus -- to come alive by saying no
- "American students are perhaps the most politically unsophisticated students in the world."

- No one would get scared if it were "Negro power"
- A psychological battle on the right for black people to self-define and self-oranize

### James Baldwin vs William Buckley, 1965 Debate at Cambridge
- Has the American Dream been achieved at the expense of the American negro?

Speaker 1: David Heycock -- **For**
- "There are more negroes in prison with me than there are on the voting rolls" -- MLK, the Selma, Alabama protests
- The state of the American Dream: great unbounded liberty, but not for one of every nine men
- American soceity uses the labor and blood of the black people but never to give them a fair deal

Speaker 2: Jeremy Burford -- **Against**
- Not the purpose to go against Civil Rights, but rather to deny the American Dream's dependence on black suffering, and that this has hindered the American Dream
- Progress in spite of the treatment of black people, not because of it
- The American Dream and the respect for civil liberties has been the main factor in improving race relations in America

Speaker 3: James Baldwin -- **For**
- There are surface-level quarrels with Burford -- yes, the treatment of the Negro has hindered the American dream, other hinderances, etc.
- A deeper awkwardness -- what is one's point of view and sense of reality: the proposition "is at the expense of" etc. is already loaded and one's reaction shows one's position in the world; assumptions that we deeply hold
- Systems allow people to attach their identities: whatever people's reactions are reveals a fundamental belief in the right of civilizations to dominate others
- Leaving aside the 'bloody catalogue', what does this do to the subjugated? -- To destroy his sense of reality. Destroy's his father's authority over him (Freud?). You have not seen a mirror, and you suppose you are white too (Lacan). Psychological beginnings which accelerate -- what you have been through is not just the catalogue of injustices, but that you have begun to see the psychological effects pervade your niece, daughter, son, etc.
- "Expense" -- The harbors, ports, economy especially of the Southern states could not have been what it is now if they had not had cheap labor.
- "I built the railroads, *I* picked the cotton, under someone's whip, for nothing"
  - What does this mean?
- The Southern oligarchy
- This 'dream' is at the 'expense' of the American Negro -- but not only in the deep South. 
- What has happened to white Southerners? "I have fallen far, so far, but at least I am not black" -- what is being done?
- Why believe that the civil rights bill will be honored now?
- White people in the South have been morally destroyed, the corruption of American sense of reality
- The problem with America is that it has been integrated for a very long time -- "put me next to another African and you'll see"
- Watching America from Europe
- It is only since WWII that there is a counterimage in the world -- Africa was suddenly on the stage of the world and Africans had to be dealt with in a way they had never been before, and gives the American Negro a sense of himself beyond the savage and the clown
- What is concerning? We like to think we are civilized in this room so that we can walk out assuming that the measure of our politeness has some effect on the world. "It may not." 
- Robert Kennedy said that it was conceivable that in 40 years in America we might have a black president. But they laughed bitterly in Harlem.
- Betrayal by American politicians. But how to deal with people who the white world has so long ignored and who are deeply skeptical of Baldwin and King?
- It is a terrible thing for white people to believe that 1/9 of their population is beneath them
- Not an object of missionary charity, but one of the people that built the country. Unless this is acknowledged, there is scarcely hope for the country.
- "The people who are denied participation in the American Dream, by their very presence, will wreck it. And that is a very grave moment for the West."

Speaker 4: William Buckley -- **Against**
- Most striking criticism of America -- involves the refusal of the American community to treat him other than a Negro
- The American community treats Baldwin with a sort of fascination
- Baldwin must be treated as a white man
- Charges against America are not so much that civilization has failed Baldwin and his people but rather that America has no ideals -- a superficial coating which justifies oppression, etc.
- Baldwin has been treated specially because he is Black
- What to eliminate psychic humiliation? 
- Not to eliminate statistics in a world which is closely attached to material prosperity
- Everything comes at the expense of effort going into a system which grants greater material prosperity
- But what is it that Americans ought to do? Is it time to abandon the American Dream?
- In the US there is a concern for the Negro problem -- the engines of concern are working, and Baldwin in part reflects this concern.
- The situation in America is very complex: a) the effort to perpetuate discrimination by individual American citizens as a result of their lack of concern; b) the failure of the Negro community itself to make certain 'exertions' which other minorities (Italian, Jewish) have made. We need to 're-animate' the Negro
- Reaching out for radical solutions to obscure the two factors. Focusing on the fact of white discrimination and agitating a moral concern, but where to go now?
- Bayard Rustin -- slipping, ends up less urging the advancement of the Black man and more the regression of the white man
- The problem in Mississippi is not that too few black people are voting but too many white people are voting
- "Racial narcissism" 
- Possibly leading towards war and conflict

Baldwin wins
