### Introduction

### Chapter 1

## Document Collection #1
### "A Frightening Message for a Thanksgiving Issue"
- Increasing fear of the possibility of mutual nuclear war after the US was no longer the sole possessor of atomic reapons
- Preparing the public for a nuclear attack -- Americans, you can survive without protective clothing or special training!
- An immanent contradiction here: fear the bomb, but also you will be fine.

> Very likely you won't finish this article, because it's about death.

- *Civil* defense
- Ultimate death and destruction resulting from the bomb
- The eternal proliferation of the cloud: radioactivity, the 'undead' coming to drag you towards death.
- Individualization -- you must save yourself, death confronts us all as individuals.
- But where to go with your family? You need a thick cellar to store and save yourself.
- Tensions between the individual and the collective
- Shelter -- what ideological, philosophical, political significance can we read in this?

### Incoming Telegram, Kennan
1: Basic Features of the Post-War Soviet Outlook
- USSR lives in "antagonistic 'capitalist encirclement'"
- Stalin: a socialist and capitalist center in the word order
- The capitalist word is beset with inherent antagonisms which cannot be resolved peacefully, esp. between England and the US
- War is endemic to capitalism
- Intervention against the USSR would delay Soviet socialism
- Capitalism is not unilaterally bad -- qua Marx, it produces conditions of enlightenment
- Moderate-socialist, socialist-democratic leaders -- Lenin's false friends of the people: these are the most dangerous elements of bourgeois-capitalist society.
- **The above premises** imply therefore that capitalism must be weakened, Soviet efforts should be directed at maximizing tensions between capitalist nations, and socialism abroad should be put down.
- To clarify, here Kennan is observing the Soviet point of view.

2: Background of Outlook
- Part 1 does not represent the "natural outlook of the Russian people" -- Russians are generally eager to reap the fruits of bourgeois-capitalist society.
- Premises in part 1 are not true: socialism as backwardsness; war is not endemic to capitalism; 'insanity' of doubting the good naturedness of moderate socialism. Falseness demonstrated -- how? empirically perhaps?
- Soviet propaganda is not "objective", but comes from a "neurotic view of the world" -- linked with the "traditional" Russian "insecurity". The West as more competent and powerful. Russians as motivated by a stupid defense of backwardsness and archaicity.
- Marxist dogma: becomes the theoretical vehicle for insecurity, a 'sacrifice of ethics' (Zizek: behind every genocide there is a poet). 
- Russian nationalism smuggled under international Marxism: ignorance, mental dependence to the point of castration. Lack of access to "unbiased" information. **Oriental secretiveness**. 
- Is there a certain kind of racialization going on here?
- Disrespect for objective truth

3: Projection of Soviet Outlook in Practical Policy on Official Level
- Soviet policy has a 'visible' and 'invisible' (subterranean) dimension
- Participation in international organizations (Jewry? Is there a connection here -- conspiracy? Semitism -- Zizek, the figure of the Jew who embodies the ultimate contradiction needed to maintain the appearance of the ontological consistency of a theory)
- Strategic alliances and conquering to embolden the Soviet state
- Participation in colonization of conquered people -- this is interesting.
- Base and superstructure, qua Marx: economic reform and the ideological, legal, militaristic components

4: The Unconscious Subterranean Plane
- Underground operating of world communism
- Many associations in the US such as women's organizations, labor unions, racial societies, etc. can be "dominated or influenced by such penetration"
- Is there a Freudian perspective we can think about?
- Religion and pan-Slavic movements -- this is an interesting complicating factor. Precisely the ability to overcome differences is what endows the Soviet spirit with its omniscient power?
- Encouragement of violence, and a violent synthesis of a dialectical contradiction -- black and white (!!!), poro and rich, young and old, etc. This is the critical mediating (disrupting?) element which completes the triad, which moves from two to three
- Manipulate influence on colonized peoples, weaken colonial policy.
- Communists will destroy personal liberty and freedom
- Setting Western Powers against each other -- more dialectical enforcement
- Soviet regime as a 'police regime'

5: Practical Deductions for US Policy
- Fanatical commitment to destroying the US and the American way of life.
- Borne from a deep Russian nationalism
- Soviet power is a logic of force -- almost physical, brunt.
- Soviets are still weaker!
- Soviet system still may not work! After Stalin's death.
- Soviet propaganda can be easily beaten!
- Placement of the US nto a position of universality via commimtent to objectivity and detachment -- movement outside of a fanatic particularity
- 'Educate' the public on the Russian situation. In fact the obejctive is not to breed rampant anti-Sovietism but to do so rationally, to claim the appearance of rationality. This is interesting now. What kind of engendering is being done upon the Soviets here?
- The courage to cling to 'our conceptions' of human society -- do not cope, do not allow the parasite to take over.
- Interesting ideological analysis which can be done on this work -- contradictions and tensions abound.
