## *Kennedy and the Promise of the Sixties*, Rorabaugh
### Introduction
- The early 60s were a time of promise and optimism: science, wealth, technology, improving life
- A society balancing between fulfilling and making promises: getting hooked on promises
- When hope gets too far ahead of experience, this difference kills hope
- Desire and reason: did desire govern more?
- Dark undercurrents: eroding tradition, difficulties in gender and sexuality -- an insistence on promising. Let's ride on the surface!
  - Contradiction between phenomena and noumean explored in music
  - Tension between public and private
  - Collapse of censorship and rising counterculture; coarsening of discourse
  - Postmodernity
- Why should we look at the 60s?
  - Complex interactions between the political, social, and culture
  - These interactions became in excess of themselves: liberation of the self from social constraints
  - The 60s are a crucial formative period in American politics
- 60s as a change in tone from the conservatism of the 50s -- a move from the complacent and comformist to the radical
- Kennedy: mastery of the television but failure to do much as president; cautious but bold; a president of spectacle. 


### Chapter 1: Kennedy
- The 1960s and John Kennedy have a very close relationship with each other
- Americans already sensed they were entering a promising time leading up to the start of the 60s
- The 50s as the Great Barbecue
  - Criticism of Eisenhower as lethargic, a do-nothing.
  - Vapidity of consumerism
  - Not everyone can enjoy the great barbecue
- McCarthy's anti-communist smears of the 50s form an intellectual vacuum
- Eisenhower as a master of deception; ruthless government across the world. 
- Nixon becomes Eisenhower's VP, but not a good candidate: widely hated. A 'middle class uneducated swindler' without moral compass
- Kennedy declares for presidency in January 2, 1960 -- opening oft the decade. Projected forwards unrelenting optimism
- Turned youth into an advantage
- Kennedy's family was very important
- Jack was a war hero; stranded on island and survived by sending a coconut message
- Suspicious relationship with McCarthy
- Question of being Catholic: can a Catholic be allected?
- Remaking of American politics, almost populist: appealing directly to voters, grassroots campaigning
- Rise of data-driven, strategic, careerized politicking 
- Kennedy suffered from chronic poor health, which he hid
- Kennedy's personal relationship was scandalous and tenuous
- Kennedy grew coalitional support in very complex and tense ways, almost surpassing logic
- Strategic action with Civil Rights leaders to get a larger share of the Black vote
- Wins very narrowly
- Inaugural address: ignores domestic affairs, very global and international -- reframes the role of the citizen and the government
- Reshaping of the aides: smart and intellectual (a source of criticism, detached from common sense); egalitarian and chaotic; creative but poor coordination.
- A liberal fantasy paradise for three months, interrupted by the Bay of Pigs invasion.

## Document Collection #1
### "A Frightening Message for a Thanksgiving Issue"
- Increasing fear of the possibility of mutual nuclear war after the US was no longer the sole possessor of atomic reapons
- Preparing the public for a nuclear attack -- Americans, you can survive without protective clothing or special training!
- An immanent contradiction here: fear the bomb, but also you will be fine.

> Very likely you won't finish this article, because it's about death.

- *Civil* defense
- Ultimate death and destruction resulting from the bomb
- The eternal proliferation of the cloud: radioactivity, the 'undead' coming to drag you towards death.
- Individualization -- you must save yourself, death confronts us all as individuals.
- But where to go with your family? You need a thick cellar to store and save yourself.
- Tensions between the individual and the collective
- Shelter -- what ideological, philosophical, political significance can we read in this?

### Incoming Telegram, Kennan
1: Basic Features of the Post-War Soviet Outlook
- USSR lives in "antagonistic 'capitalist encirclement'"
- Stalin: a socialist and capitalist center in the word order
- The capitalist word is beset with inherent antagonisms which cannot be resolved peacefully, esp. between England and the US
- War is endemic to capitalism
- Intervention against the USSR would delay Soviet socialism
- Capitalism is not unilaterally bad -- qua Marx, it produces conditions of enlightenment
- Moderate-socialist, socialist-democratic leaders -- Lenin's false friends of the people: these are the most dangerous elements of bourgeois-capitalist society.
- **The above premises** imply therefore that capitalism must be weakened, Soviet efforts should be directed at maximizing tensions between capitalist nations, and socialism abroad should be put down.
- To clarify, here Kennan is observing the Soviet point of view.

2: Background of Outlook
- Part 1 does not represent the "natural outlook of the Russian people" -- Russians are generally eager to reap the fruits of bourgeois-capitalist society.
- Premises in part 1 are not true: socialism as backwardsness; war is not endemic to capitalism; 'insanity' of doubting the good naturedness of moderate socialism. Falseness demonstrated -- how? empirically perhaps?
- Soviet propaganda is not "objective", but comes from a "neurotic view of the world" -- linked with the "traditional" Russian "insecurity". The West as more competent and powerful. Russians as motivated by a stupid defense of backwardsness and archaicity.
- Marxist dogma: becomes the theoretical vehicle for insecurity, a 'sacrifice of ethics' (Zizek: behind every genocide there is a poet). 
- Russian nationalism smuggled under international Marxism: ignorance, mental dependence to the point of castration. Lack of access to "unbiased" information. **Oriental secretiveness**. 
- Is there a certain kind of racialization going on here?
- Disrespect for objective truth

3: Projection of Soviet Outlook in Practical Policy on Official Level
- Soviet policy has a 'visible' and 'invisible' (subterranean) dimension
- Participation in international organizations (Jewry? Is there a connection here -- conspiracy? Semitism -- Zizek, the figure of the Jew who embodies the ultimate contradiction needed to maintain the appearance of the ontological consistency of a theory)
- Strategic alliances and conquering to embolden the Soviet state
- Participation in colonization of conquered people -- this is interesting.
- Base and superstructure, qua Marx: economic reform and the ideological, legal, militaristic components

4: The Unconscious Subterranean Plane
- Underground operating of world communism
- Many associations in the US such as women's organizations, labor unions, racial societies, etc. can be "dominated or influenced by such penetration"
- Is there a Freudian perspective we can think about?
- Religion and pan-Slavic movements -- this is an interesting complicating factor. Precisely the ability to overcome differences is what endows the Soviet spirit with its omniscient power?
- Encouragement of violence, and a violent synthesis of a dialectical contradiction -- black and white (!!!), poro and rich, young and old, etc. This is the critical mediating (disrupting?) element which completes the triad, which moves from two to three
- Manipulate influence on colonized peoples, weaken colonial policy.
- Communists will destroy personal liberty and freedom
- Setting Western Powers against each other -- more dialectical enforcement
- Soviet regime as a 'police regime'

5: Practical Deductions for US Policy
- Fanatical commitment to destroying the US and the American way of life.
- Borne from a deep Russian nationalism
- Soviet power is a logic of force -- almost physical, brunt.
- Soviets are still weaker!
- Soviet system still may not work! After Stalin's death.
- Soviet propaganda can be easily beaten!
- Placement of the US nto a position of universality via commimtent to objectivity and detachment -- movement outside of a fanatic particularity
- 'Educate' the public on the Russian situation. In fact the obejctive is not to breed rampant anti-Sovietism but to do so rationally, to claim the appearance of rationality. This is interesting now. What kind of engendering is being done upon the Soviets here?
- The courage to cling to 'our conceptions' of human society -- do not cope, do not allow the parasite to take over.
- Interesting ideological analysis which can be done on this work -- contradictions and tensions abound.

### Kitchen Debates, 1959
- Nixon and Khrushchev -- at the US Embassy in Moscow
- Nixon showing kitchen to Khrushchev.
- The kitchen is equipped with appliances to make women's lives easier -- Khrushchev says that this 'capitalist attitude' towards women does not occur under Communism. 
- Universalization of the domestication of women -- making life easier
- Differences of temporality -- what goes out of date and what doesn't?
- What is the Soviet man? Not quite so backwards as in the American imagination...
- Who is the slave? who has freedom?
- Free exchange and free ideas -- but what is the critical particular edge to universalizing free exchange?
- Battle of progresion -- who will go further?
- The question of translation and mutual understanding

### Montgomery Bus Boycott Threat, 1954
- *Women's* political council
- Mediocre reform: black people sit from back to front, and white people from front to back
- Patronization of buses by black people

### Brown v. Board of Education, 1954
- 14th amendment invoked -- separation of white and black children in public schools on the basis of race
- Segregation deprives minority children of equal opportunity even if 'tangible' factors are equal
- Separate but equal in Plessy v. Ferguson cannot continue
- Segregated public schools can never be equal; they are deprived of equal protection
  - Beyond differential outcomes: what would be wrong about separate but equal but *truly* equal, assuming this is hypothetically possible? Or is this a false question?
- Removal of legal distinctions?
- Equalization of 'tangible' factors -- the decision cannot turn on a comparison of the material consequential outcomes, but rather the effect of *segregation itself* (yes! my previous question)
- Education is an important governmental function, and it is important for a democratic society. Education is a right.
- Does segregation of children on race deprive minority children of equal educational opportunities? SC opinion: it does.
  - Generation of feelings of inferiority, which impedes learning
  - Appeal to psychological finding
  - Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal (can this be applied to other dimensions which we feel are more acceptable?)

### Birmingham Public Accommodation Segregation Laws
- Unlawful for control of any area in which both black and white people are allowed with equal geophysical relation
- White and nonwhite people must be separated in different rooms or by a partition in restaurant
- A black and white person *cannot play together*
- Equal but separate accomodation for black and white people
- Take the seat to which you *belong*
- Interesting geopolitical divide of space: and why? Maybe it is a naive question: but why this doctrine of separate but equal? Why spatial demarcation?

### Southern Manifesto, 1956
- Supreme Court involvement in segregation cases -- "substitute naked power for established law"
- Appeal to Founding Fathers, legal conservatism, overstepping of the Constitution, abuse of judicial power
- "Climaxes a trend" in the judiciary branch to legislate -- increasing 'politicization' of the court?
- Constitution does not mention education
  - Essentially a shallow and strict textualist reading
- Argument that the 14th amendment odes not conflict with the doctrine of separate but equal
- Appeal to the right of parents to direct their children's education
  - What is wrong about this?
  - Maybe we should dismantle the parental instinct.
- The court ruling is "destroying amicable relations" -- a vision of a fall from purity, now suspicion and hatred
- "outside meddlers"
- Some states declared resistance to forced integration
- No appeal at all to the actual separate but equal law -- instead an appeal to the protection of racial discrimination under the Constitution, or at least the lack of objection to it which can be found in the Constitution
