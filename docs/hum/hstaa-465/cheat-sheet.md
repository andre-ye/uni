## Lecture 2: WWII and the New World Order
World War II brought a sense 
that global order was needed to stave off 
another great conflagration in the future, but 
the emergence of the United States and the 
Soviet Union as two great competing forces 
introduced a new destabilizing conflict

| Term | Description|
| --- | --- |
| Bretton Woods conference | 1944 conference in which world leaders got together to discuss economics post-WWII: creation of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to help contries after the war. Plays into a sense of global recovery. |
| United Nations | 1945, New York -- established with the mission to collective keep peace, to create a body which would solve problems before they arise. However, with the establishment of the UN, many countries began pointing at the US' poor Civil Rights record. A strong push for Civil Rights comes with Cold War criticism from foreign countries. |
| Marshall Islands | Chosen by the atomic energy commission for tests; in 1946 the Baker Test at Bikini Atoll is done. Part of an attempt to understand the new-found power of atomic energy. |
| Long Telegram | Written by diplomat George Kennan, the 1946 telegram reports to the US state government what is happening in the Soviet Union, and recommends the US formally reocgnize the USSR as an enemy and begin strategic planning. |
| Truman Doctrine | 1947: Lending large amounts of money to places in the world so they don't fall under the influecne of the Soviet Union, and providing military aid, such as to Turkey and Greece. Truman wanted to see Germany unified. A belief that there were two worlds -- one free, one not -- and that one needed to show the goodness of freedom. |
| Castle Bravo Test | 1954 test in the Marshall Islands, in which the released power exceeded the projection by 2505x, and was 1000x larger than the Hiroshima bomb. Illustrates the extent to which scientists were still uanware of the full extent of the nuclear technologies thye were developing. |
| Decolonization | The end of WWII marked a beginning of a chain of decolonization efforts. The US had given the Phillippines Independence in 1946, and pressured Great Britain to give up their colonies as well, emphasizing a belief in the self-determination of nations. |
| The "loss" of China | Communists in China win the Civil War in 1949; although the US had never possessed China, they perceived it as a 'loss' to Communism -- illustrative of the zero-sum game with which the battle against Communism was perceived. This "loss" would put presure on Truman to adopt foreign policy which would mitigate other countries from following a similar path. |
| Iran, Guatemala, Cuba, Vietnam... | The US provides aid to Iran, Saudi Arabia, and many South-East Asian nations out of fear of Communism in the 1950s. There is a concern domestically if the US becomes a garrison state which raises taxes, has a global military presence, and becomes almost totalarian in its defense of formal freedom. |
| NSC-68 | 1950 US Policy statement that the Cold War is an epic struggle between freedom and the slavery and grim oligarchy of communism, and that foreign policy would be the site at which this struggle was waged. The need for containment mired the US in wars. This means that American taxpayers have a hefty bill to pay. |
| Nationalization of Resources | In 1953, Iran accepts Mohammed Mossadegh's nationalization of Iranian oil as opposed to giving it to other foreign companies (Anglo-Iranian oil company). In 1956 the Egyptian president Nasser wants to nationalize the Suez Canal in Egypt for Egyptions. Likewise with land in Guatemala. The west opposed the nationalization of resources in such nations by military or political force. |
| Oil for Security | A 1945 agreement with Saudi Arabia to provide oil agreements, which America needed to suppoprt its heavily mechanized armies as well as its growing consumer product industries. |
| Korean War | 1948 - 1950: The Korean War becomes a test of US containment policy and a focal point of the early Cold War. Kim Il Sung (communist) agianst Syngman Rhee (anti-communist authoritarian). A battleground between major powers waged over Korea: the United States against the Chinese- and USSR-supported Communist Korean forces. |
| The "Iron Curtain" | 1946: A claim of post-WWII territory by the Soviet Union -- an iron curtain has descended across the European continent. Further entrenched the zero-sum logic of the cold war by demarcating areas 'not open to the free world'. |
| McCarthyism | From the late 1940s to the mid 1950s, Senator Joseph McCarthy made himself well known by suggesting that the US political structure was riddled with communist subversives. |
| Garrison State | The concern that the United States was becoming a military state which continually needed American taxes to fund its military endeavors, which it justified in the name of freedom and containment abroad. |
| Hydrogen Bomb | 1952 development of fusion bombs which were much more powerful than atomic bombs. Something poetic that the most inocuous element, hydrogen, is at the center of this massively destructive technology. Robert Oppenheimer and others voice opposition to the hydrogen bomb. These new technologies of mass destruction open up metaphysical questions of existence, purpose, and (the end of) history. |
| Kitchen Debates | 1959 -- meeting between Chairman Khushchev and Vice President Nixon at the opening of the American National Exhibit. Demonstrates the tensions present during this time, ideologically, culturally, and politically. That part of the debate took place in a simulacra of an American Kitchen also demonstrates a greater awareness that the domestic is political. |
| Mutually Assured Destruction | A new logic of weapons of mass destruction in which the goal was to not need to use weapons -- the function of a nuclear weapon is to sit there and wait, and emenates pure deterrent forces. There is an investment purely into image and *negativity*. A free soceity builds large nuclear stockpiles and takes large taxes, but using them is to lose. A new logic in the technological era.

## Lecture 3: The Struggle for Civil Rights to 1961
WWII changed the 
conversation over civil rights by 
placing the United States in a struggle 
for human freedom. The war’s 
outcome and the meanings of the 
Cold War empowered new leaders, 
spurred new efforts, led to new tactics 
that advanced civil rights in America.

| Term | Description|
| --- | --- |
| A. Philip Randolph | In 1941, Randolph conceived of a March on Washington as the US is entering WWII; under Randolph's pressure, Roosevelt had to make important policy concessions. Represented a major push to unify Black Americans. |
| Executive Order 8802 | 1941 prohibition of discrimination in the defense industries, a result of Randolph's threats. |
| The Bracero Program | 1942 to 1964. Bracero -- means 'labor / worker' in Spanish. An invitation for Mexicans to come and work in the US until 1964, where there is a large change in immigration policy. A result of large changes in American agriculture. Similarly, many Black people are moving from rural to urban settings, shifting from agricultural to industrial work. Demonstrates changing economic situations and human movement post-WWII, an opening up. |
| Rosie the Riveter | Rosie the Riveter is white, but black women also served in the same industrial defense jobs during WWII. |
| Redlining and Racial covenants | Institutional and structural restrictions put on people of color -- where you can live, insurance, real estate, banks, etc. Present even in places like Seattle. Few Black people are able to buy a home, and are unable to use this home as capital. Demonstration of systematic 'on-the-books-off-the-book' systematic discrimination, even post-WWII, which many black people served in. |
| Jackie Robinson | 1947 -- was a lietenant in the army, but goes on to become an important Civil Rights leader. Was tried for insubordination, and practiced bus sit-ins. Another demonstration of Civil Rights resistance post-WWII. |
| Black Internationalism | An intellectual movement linking global colonialism to Black disenfranchisement. Alternatively known as pan-Africanism. Asserts the plight of people of African descent, whereever they are. Franz Fanon, Du Bois, Robeson. Highlights colonial relationships and tensions in the US. |
| Human Rights | Eleanor Roosevelt's 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights -- equal in dignity, without distinction of any kind. The irony is that the US will not sign it because of the Southern legacy of Blck oppression -- John Dulles refuses to sign for fear that it will open up international investigation of the "Negro question". Post-WWII, people are becoming very aware of the racial problem, and the US Civil Rights record significantly damages the US' ability to function in the UN. |
| Brown v. Board of Education | 1954 Kansas ruling -- highly calculated, not spontaneous. The NAACP had been looking for how to argue desegregation in the judicial system in the best place. A focus on Kansas as 'in between North and South' would bring more national attention. Main argument: by forcing Black students to walk much farther to go to segregated schools, it is uneven. Overturning of 'separate but equal' which is not really equal in education. |
| SNCC | SNCC is a very different institution compared tot he SCLC (which emerges in 1956) -- it doesn't really have a leadership, almost intentionally, and in fact is quite critical of the SCLC's top-heavy nature. Illustrates the diversity of Civil Rights approaches and efforts leading up to the 1960s. |
| CORE | 1942, Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) -- an important Black Civil Rights organization which will continue to play an important role throughout. Rresponsible later for more militant movement, such as the 1961 freedom rides | 
| "To Secure These Rights" | 1948, statement released by Truman administration which declared the presence of a serious racial problem in America. Discussed how racism weakened the country because it opened it up to criticsm by the Communist party, and that Racism was an open wound which would bring down the country. However it reads sort of complacently, with a focus on broad structural forces but doesn't really point the finger at anything. Truman later integrates the armed forces and sets up ways for women to have permanent career paths in the military. Part of an effort post-WWII to advance the Civil Rights agenda. |
| Pluralism | FDR talks a lot about pluralism in wartime -- bringing different lands together. However this is a pluralism which exposes an immanent contradiction -- the US is not living out its pluralist vision. |
| Southern Manifesto | 1956 document opposing racial integration in public spaces and showing the Southern states acting as one legislative bloc on the subject of racial integration. |
| Emmett Till | 1955 murder of Emmet Till -- significant because it had resonance within Black communities in the North. |
| Rosa Parks | Rosa Parks, a longtime member of the NAACP, is a practiced activist, and embarks on her famous bus trips in 1955. |
| Ella Baker | Involved with SNCC in 1960 -- focuses on organizing young people and knew it would be young people who would be the vanguard of Civil Rights. Was focused on getting away from people like MLK and putting the roles in the hands of the 'every-people' -- a decentralized movement is stronger. |
| Robert Moses | A Northerner who came down to the South and did the same kind of organizing work among young people |
| Sit-ins | 1960 sit-ins, mostly student led movements to occupy and violate segregated spaces. Later on, movements would target movement between state lines more than just occupying segregated spaces. Many young black people were killed as they attempted to do wade-ins. |
| Freedom Rides | 1961, the CORE begins taking long bus rides to further challenge the status quo; a follow-up to sit-ins. At first, CORE is doing bus rides in the upper South and going from state-to-state in Virginia, and this doesn't raise as much publicity. Rather, gets the federal government involved by going across states. Taking buses from New York to Alabama -- the result is much, much more violent. Indicates a shift from stationary to moving demonstrations in the early sixties. |

## Lecture 4: Prosperity, Consumierms, and Environment
The modernist view of a 
consumer-driven economy, which 
began around 1920, seemed to 
reach is zenith by about 1960 only to 
encounter new challenges in health, 
environment, discrimination, and the 
emergence of economic citizenship.

| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Federal Housing Act | 1934 restructuring of the mortgage industry -- changes in federal policies would be one of the most significant economic changes to come out of  WWII on housing. After increasing wages after the war, more and more poeple are moving into suburban spaces. |
| Keynesian economics | Emergence of a consensus around Keynesian economic theory after the war -- if the state could mobilize so well during wartime, why not in peacetime as well? Dind't want to see a massive dip in consumption and production post-war. |
| Tupperware | Indicates a proliferation of plastics -- although plastics hadn't played much of a role in American life, war research produced a lot of plastics technlology which was now being put into consumer products. Brownie Wise was a leading advocate of Tupperware. A post-war success story. |
| Workers' health/consumers' health | There is emerging concern about public health given proliferation of chemicals and products. |
| DDT | DDT is initially used in war but is being deployed as a pesticide. Used to address the large gypspy moth problem in Long Island. Attracts Rachel Carson. Wide use of chemicals in unprecedented ways post-war. |
| Silent Spring | Rachel Carson, a biologist in Johns Hopkins interested in stories about nature and environmentalism. The 1962 *Silent Spring* was meant to inspire women (targets of consumerism) and also points the finger at the entymologists and other federal agents to produce sterile, insect-free environments. Rising fears of nuclear threats. Silent Spring makes a big splash; Kennedy read it. Strong criticism between the intimacy between the state and the indusrtry. *Silent Spring* is an important book to produce Kennedy's consumer bill of rights. |
| Baby teeth study, Strontium-90 | 1959 Baby Teeth Experiment shows that strontium-90 is showing up in baby teeth; it rests in human bones and behave like calcium. A discovery of the rapid *unseen* proliferation of chemicals. |
| Post-war chemicals | |
| GI Bill | 1944, major change to American life after WW2. Millions of Americans can get zero percent down loan with zero percent interest to build a farm, go to college, buy a house, etc. – many could not do so before, now can do so. However, many of the same racial restrictions are in place -- that is, locally restricted, laws are left ambiguous to local codes which are still racist in the south. |
| Suburban space | Expanse of suburban living and the single-family home, which radically changes American life. Massive Levitowns emerge, a new kind of rapidly built shoddy griddy American suburban sprawling neighborhood. With increasing wages after the war, more and more people are moving into suburban spaces. Part of this life is about ‘materialism’ – living in new suburban spaces with more consumer products than before – all these new things to put in people’s homes. Moreover, cars are central to navigating this new suburban environment. | 
| Planned obsolescence | Market thinking and advertisement thinking spreads throughout the economy. Products are designed to become obsolete. Waste is a byproduct of the capitalist system: it increases standards of living and produces commodities, but much waste. An emergence of taste economy, and massive proliferation of landfills -- the excess of civilization. |
| Economic citizenship | Increasingly, idea of American freedom is being connected to economic citizenship – to be an American citizen is to have a certain standard of living: at least a middle-class existence. Americans increasingly worry less about the political sphere and more about an economic sphere existence. By 1960, this swing has begun to happen. |
| FIFRA | 1947 -- starts out as an attempt to protect consumers, turns into a snake oil law -- no advertising if it doesn't work. An initial attempt to protect consumers which ends up being weak and needs further bolstering later on, especially going into the sixties. |
| Landfills | By the 60s and the late 70s, landfills begin to proliferate over America and aren't regulated until they start causing problems. The issue is that landfills leak nasty materials into the water and show up in people's drinking supplies. Staten Island, New York has the largest landfill in the world by 1955. Demonstrates the rapid growth of the consumer economy and production industries leading up to the sixties -- the creation of the consumerist mateiralist economy. |
| Kennedy's consumer bill of rights | 1962 -- "Consumers, by definition, include us all." A declaration of the consumer as needing government support to live a safe late. Observation of growing pressure on the consumer to play all roles. |
| Partial nuclear test ban | 1963 -- Kennedy signs the partial nuclear test ban (but does not ban nuclear testing). What was before radical during the McCarthyite era was now common -- middle-class American protesting against atmospheric testing. Kennedy's signing into law demonstrates a greater political and environmental consciousness in relationship to war and commodities. |

## Lecture 5: Critique, Discontent, and Alternatives

The influences of African American art forms and the impulse to 
non-conformity helped to further fragment 
the 1960s as especially young people 
searched for alternate forms of expression

| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Conformity, Non-Conformity | Although American culture undergoes heavy conformist checks in ideology (Cold War, McCarthyism, etc.), in the 1950s and 1960s there is greater discontent being publicly voiced. Comformist boundaries are being violated. |
| Critiques of Mass Society | Many critiques of mass society emerge such as *The Lonely Crowd* and *The Affluent Society*. The important takeaway here is that people, at least some people, are critically aware of the changes in economics, macro and micro, and how that is changing public and private relationships. |
| Allen Ginsburg's "Howl" | 1955, a centerpiece of the counterculture which articualtes something which is wrong about the mass proliferation of consumerism. Becomes an intellectual and artistic keystone in understanding the 1950s and 1960s discontent. |
| Expatriates | James Baldwin, Richard Wright, Arthur Himes -- many writers become expatriates, sometimes for racial reasons (Baldwin felt that he was treated better outside of the US) and others to critique American society 'from the outside'. |
| The Beats | A group of writers and thinkers who sought to express the 'being beat' of mass conformist culture and articulate novel visions of freedom. |
| Hipsters | Hipsters were strongly influenced by Black art forms and emerge in the 1950s to 1960s, tied with the beats. There is an intentional wrking class affectation which is key to the hipster aesthetic. What is important is that the hipster is a dimension of the market system -- they go to the fringes of what is acceptable, take from it, and bring it back to the mainstream. Norman Mailer -- "The White Negro" |
| Be-Bop | A new form of jazz which is fast, loud, experimental, and exploratory. It is abraisive at times. Represents a new music which is less focused on conformism and more on expression. |
| Jazz | Jazz works alongside the Beats to articulte new forms of freedom in musical form: Miles Davis, Bud Powell, Billie Holiday, etc. Jazz also has an important racial dimension: most Jazz musicians were Black and obviously Jazz has a tradition in African-American culture. Many Jazz musicians could not enter the venues they played at in the front, some were beaten by the police, etc. |
| The Folk Movement | Founded in individuals like Pete Seeger, travels around and plays a lot of music. Concentration on ‘folk’ – supposed to be the music of the people. Peter Seeger reflecting on the IWW – unionism and togetherness, stirring up the people. Utah Phillips. Bob Dylan comes of age in the 20s; recalls the communist influence of the 1930s labor activism – particularly Woody Guthrie. Reflecting on the 1930s labor activism, critique of the government |

## Lecture 6: Kennedy and the Cold War
Kennedy’s short tenure as President 
showed him to be a Cold Warrior who was 
ready to fight the spread of communism, but 
his experiences in office altered his political 
rhetoric by 1963 to a focus on World Peace.

| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Cuban Missle Crisis | 1962 -- Soviet Missiles are found in Cuba, they have IRBMs which can virtually reach anywhere in the US. There is tremendous tension: peole are fearful that this will come to a nuclear conflict. Consequentially, Kennedy and Khushev couldn’t really talk to each other – ambassador to ambassador, department to department. Getting communiques which are supported to be from Khushchev, but maybe not really Khushchev saying these things – communication breakdowns and problems. Importantly, the Cuban Missile Crisis was a turning point in Kennedy's administration, in the Cold War, and in the usage of nuclear weapons in general. It was the sort of postmodern culmination of deterrent energy. |
| Bay of Pigs Invasion | 1961 -- Kennedy allows expatriates to infiltrate Cuba to overthrow Castro; however, pulls back crucial supplies like air support; seen as indecisive. The overthrow fails, and the US is internationally embarrassed. This may demonstrate Kennedy's indecisiveness as a political leader and importantly plays into his desire to show resolve against communism in the future, which will be important when understanding his relationship with Vietnam. |
| U-2 spy planes |  The US maintains spy plane initiatives at high altitudes to spy on many places, and the USSR also does with us -- both sides know this. This is a mutual surveillance which is part of the deterrent logic of nuclear weapons. |
| Advisors in Vietnam | By 1963, 16k advisors are going into operations and getting involved in combat operations in Vietnam. Like in Cuba, the Kennedy administration is committed to 'war of no deaths' -- so mainly training the local resistance in Vietnam to fight. However this will turn into boots on the ground in 1965, just two years later. |
| Containment in Vietnam | Vietnam takes on an important symbolic role; it is important that the Communist forces are contained in Vietnam. |
| Domino Theory | The idea that if one Communist movement were to prevail, others would also. Placed increased importance on fighting in Vietnam even though it wasn't that significant to Americans 'objectively. |
| Ngo Dinh Diem | The US begins to support Ngo Dinh Diem under Eisenhower who rises to power in Southern Vietnam. However he is a despot and assassinated in 1963; after tremendous conflict, a new general Khahn arises, which the US backs. |
| Buddhists' Protests | Buddhists were often the target of religious laws by a mostly Catholic Southern Vietnamese elite. Some Buddhists participated in high-profile immolation as protest, to which Madame Nhu referred to as "barbecue" |
| Speech at American University | Towards the end of his presidency, Kennedy begins to demonstrate a focus on world peace and taking a critical view at communism. |
| Gemini Program | 1961 Space Program to test differetn methods of space travel and mechanics. Part of a broader technological race in the Cold War. |
| Counter-Insurgency | The US puts a lot of effort into training for the war, which sinks them more deeply in Vietnam. |
| Operation MONGOOSE | A covert plot to kill Castro, worked on heavily by Kennedy and Dulles. This in turn pushed Castro closer tot he Soviets; he knew he was being targeted by the US. However Castro didn't want to be a Soviet satellite. |
| Green Berets | Green Berets play an important advisoral role in Vietnam by going into the mountains and training tribal people to be armies for the South. By 1963, there were 950 Green Berets in Vietnam. |
| Assassinations of 1963 | Medgar Evers, Kennedy. A greater use of violence to demonstrate political ends. Later would be the 65 assassination of Malcolm X and the 68 assassination of MLK Jr. Also notable are the deaths of 1963: Sylvia Plath, Aldous Huxley, W.E.B. Du Bois, Patrick Kennedy, CS Lewis, Robert Frost, Thich Quang Duc, Francis Poulenc and Edith Piaf... |

## Lecture 7: Civil Rights -- Policy and Activism During 1964 and 1965

The height of the Civil Rights movement 
brought policy changes and helped to alter 
American politics of both the left and right as 
well as creating a new pluralist America.

| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Birmingham, AL | After the Civil War, Birmingham is one of thef ew Southern cities where there is an effort to invest a lot of capital by Northern industrialists to create an industrial town. Birmingham is at the center of reconstruction investment. Birmingham becomes an important place to stake a stand; a lot of Black folks have a stake in Civil Rights there; black people still remain second class. Birmingham becomes a centerpiece of Civil RIghts. By 1963, Birmingham had become a very violent place. A lot of strategy was centered here. |
| Civil Rights Act | The Civil Rights Act of 1964 -- prohibited discrimination in schools *and* privately owned institutions. The South got away previously with discrimination via public/private divide (14thd eosnt apply to private institutions). Included discrimination based on sex, which was an interesting development. Many employers continued to discriminate on the basis of sex because of the biological component there. Moreover, the '64 act did not mention voting, which was a major Civil Rights issue. In general, while the Civil Rights act, bolstered by LBJ passing it through congress, seeing Civil Rights as politically expedient, it left a lot to be wanted. Still it marked progress. |
| Medgar Evers | The first 'martyr' of the Civil Rights movement; first of Baldwin's "trinity of assassinations" (Evers, Malcolm X, King) -- workedo n many issues in the SOuth, including the Mississippi wade-ins, Emmett Till's murder, the Mississippi NAACP. Killed in his own home by a white supremacist, one of the assassinations which leads to the November '63 JFK assassination. |
| Fannie Lou Hamer | A local activist in Mississippi who engages in local agitation adn activation; becomes a voice of the struggle in Mississippi at the Democratc Convention. Demonstrates the nationwide focus on specific issues of Civil Rights in the South, and the connectedness of the Civil Rights movements. |
| 1964 Presidential Election | Democratic Convention in 1964 -- important Civil Rights influences. ... 
| Voting Rights Act
| 24th Amendment
