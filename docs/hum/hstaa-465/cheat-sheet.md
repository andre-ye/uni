## Lecture 2: WWII and the New World Order
World War II brought a sense 
that global order was needed to stave off 
another great conflagration in the future, but 
the emergence of the United States and the 
Soviet Union as two great competing forces 
introduced a new destabilizing conflict

| Term | Description|
| --- | --- |
| Bretton Woods conference | 1944 conference in which world leaders got together to discuss economics post-WWII: creation of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to help contries after the war. Plays into a sense of global recovery. |
| United Nations | 1945, New York -- established with the mission to collective keep peace, to create a body which would solve problems before they arise. However, with the establishment of the UN, many countries began pointing at the US' poor Civil Rights record. A strong push for Civil Rights comes with Cold War criticism from foreign countries. |
| Marshall Islands | Chosen by the atomic energy commission for tests; in 1946 the Baker Test at Bikini Atoll is done. Part of an attempt to understand the new-found power of atomic energy. |
| Long Telegram | Written by diplomat George Kennan, the 1946 telegram reports to the US state government what is happening in the Soviet Union, and recommends the US formally reocgnize the USSR as an enemy and begin strategic planning. |
| Truman Doctrine | 1947: Lending large amounts of money to places in the world so they don't fall under the influecne of the Soviet Union, and providing military aid, such as to Turkey and Greece. Truman wanted to see Germany unified. A belief that there were two worlds -- one free, one not -- and that one needed to show the goodness of freedom. |
| Castle Bravo Test | 1954 test in the Marshall Islands, in which the released power exceeded the projection by 2505x, and was 1000x larger than the Hiroshima bomb. Illustrates the extent to which scientists were still uanware of the full extent of the nuclear technologies thye were developing. |
| Decolonization | The end of WWII marked a beginning of a chain of decolonization efforts. The US had given the Phillippines Independence in 1946, and pressured Great Britain to give up their colonies as well, emphasizing a belief in the self-determination of nations. |
| The "loss" of China | Communists in China win the Civil War in 1949; although the US had never possessed China, they perceived it as a 'loss' to Communism -- illustrative of the zero-sum game with which the battle against Communism was perceived. This "loss" would put presure on Truman to adopt foreign policy which would mitigate other countries from following a similar path. |
| Iran, Guatemala, Cuba, Vietnam... | The US provides aid to Iran, Saudi Arabia, and many South-East Asian nations out of fear of Communism in the 1950s. There is a concern domestically if the US becomes a garrison state which raises taxes, has a global military presence, and becomes almost totalarian in its defense of formal freedom. |
| NSC-68 | 1950 US Policy statement that the Cold War is an epic struggle between freedom and the slavery and grim oligarchy of communism, and that foreign policy would be the site at which this struggle was waged. The need for containment mired the US in wars. This means that American taxpayers have a hefty bill to pay. |
| Nationalization of Resources | In 1953, Iran accepts Mohammed Mossadegh's nationalization of Iranian oil as opposed to giving it to other foreign companies (Anglo-Iranian oil company). In 1956 the Egyptian president Nasser wants to nationalize the Suez Canal in Egypt for Egyptions. Likewise with land in Guatemala. The west opposed the nationalization of resources in such nations by military or political force. |
| Oil for Security | A 1945 agreement with Saudi Arabia to provide oil agreements, which America needed to suppoprt its heavily mechanized armies as well as its growing consumer product industries. |
| Korean War | 1948 - 1950: The Korean War becomes a test of US containment policy and a focal point of the early Cold War. Kim Il Sung (communist) agianst Syngman Rhee (anti-communist authoritarian). A battleground between major powers waged over Korea: the United States against the Chinese- and USSR-supported Communist Korean forces. |
| The "Iron Curtain" | 1946: A claim of post-WWII territory by the Soviet Union -- an iron curtain has descended across the European continent. Further entrenched the zero-sum logic of the cold war by demarcating areas 'not open to the free world'. |
| McCarthyism | From the late 1940s to the mid 1950s, Senator Joseph McCarthy made himself well known by suggesting that the US political structure was riddled with communist subversives. |
| Garrison State | The concern that the United States was becoming a military state which continually needed American taxes to fund its military endeavors, which it justified in the name of freedom and containment abroad. |
| Hydrogen Bomb | 1952 development of fusion bombs which were much more powerful than atomic bombs. Something poetic that the most inocuous element, hydrogen, is at the center of this massively destructive technology. Robert Oppenheimer and others voice opposition to the hydrogen bomb. These new technologies of mass destruction open up metaphysical questions of existence, purpose, and (the end of) history. |
| Kitchen Debates | 1959 -- meeting between Chairman Khushchev and Vice President Nixon at the opening of the American National Exhibit. Demonstrates the tensions present during this time, ideologically, culturally, and politically. That part of the debate took place in a simulacra of an American Kitchen also demonstrates a greater awareness that the domestic is political. |
| Mutually Assured Destruction | A new logic of weapons of mass destruction in which the goal was to not need to use weapons -- the function of a nuclear weapon is to sit there and wait, and emenates pure deterrent forces. There is an investment purely into image and *negativity*. A free soceity builds large nuclear stockpiles and takes large taxes, but using them is to lose. A new logic in the technological era.
