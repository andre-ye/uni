## John Rawls, Autobiographical Notes
- p. 50 in PDF: "How did it [*A Theory of Justice*] become so famous? It was published in 1971. Did it immediately become well known?" "That's an interesting question. I'm not the best person to answer it... Granting that, I think it gained attention from a conjunction of circumstances. You have to remember [the historical context.] It was a long time ago, so you probably don't remember. Why should you? I wouldn't remember in your place. It was during the Vietnam War and soon after the Civil Rights Movement. They dominated the politics of the day. And yet there was no recent book, no systematic treatise, you might say, on a conception of political justice."
- p. 53: We should not formulate too broad a concept of political justice. Informed opinion and due consideration are required.
- p. 54: dorm room Confederate flag controversy -- hope for an amicable solution without administrative force

## *In the Shadow of Justice*, Katrina Forrester

### Chapter 1: The Making of Justice
- John Rawls' *A Theory of Justice* launched him into fame -- very long account of justice as fairness (2)
- Revival of the liberal social contract tradition -- the original position (2)
- Rawls experience in WWII in the Pacific Theater -- inescapability of politics (3)
- After WWII, Rawls took on barebones liberalism -- limitations of concentrations of power. *A Theory of Justice* as postwar, not Great Society. (3-4)
- Forms the architecture of his theory by the end of the 1950s (4)
- Greater wariness of concentrated political adne conomic power returns to liberalism during the Keynesian rise in post-war statist growth (4-6)
- Focus on a system of objective standards for judgement without a God or state to ground it (6) + open and noncoercive justifications (7) -- emphasis on rational discussion, not appeal to authority and the law -- "radically minimalist, eliminativist"
- Racial prejudices -- p. 8
- Drawing from Wittgenstein -- morality is interpersonal, social, defined by use; the world is discovered, not chosen.
- Rawls reads pre-sixties critiques of anticommunist repression, capitalism, racial and labor suppression (11)
- Game analogies were widespread in postwar thought (13) - economics-ization
- Rawls later abandons barebons liberalism (18)
- 1957 -- Rawls at the APA, every person "has an equal right to the most extensive  liberty compatible with a like liberty for all" (25)
    - Preocuppation with moral psychology
    - An engineering problem: social mechanisms
    - Preoccupied with uncertainty and systems of control, bargaining -- Galbraith! (29)
    - Rules need more 
    - Broadening out to different modes of governance
    - Early 1950s engagement with utilitarianism and economics -- why follow rules at all? Rules are constittuive of actions
    - Late 1950s, basic structure (33) -- the rules of the game
- In the 1960s, Rawls introduces the original position, the veil of ignorance (36). Vision of society as a game. "Utilitarianism does not take seriously the distinction between persons"; individualizes people and eliminates the plurality of their relations 
    - Focus on an autonomousness of justice
- 1964 -- finishes the first full draft of *A Theory of Justice*

## Chapter 2: Obligations
- Civil Rights and antiwar movements in the 1960s (2)
- Rawls had tried to abstract from politics, but now a philosophy of public affairs is pressing (2)
- The problem of political obligation and disobedience (3)
- Stability and order in constitutional democracies as rules of the game (5)
- Commitment to postwar vision of consensus (5)
