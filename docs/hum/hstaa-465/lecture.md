## Lecture 1: The 1960s -- A Crisis of National Unity
Unfortunately my notes previously were lost because my computer lost battery and GitHub was stalling :(

- What is meant by consensus? Enough to provide definitiona nd form to the dominant culture
- Consensus over what? What was broken? What happens to the stories which hold the US together?
- American exceptionalism: the grand narrative of US history
- The acceptnace of New Deal liberalism
- WWII entirely changes the coordinates
- High unemployment in the US
- The US is built up by WWII -- the world's leading manufacturing econoy, an explosion of the middle class. WWII shapes everything. The monolith of WWII casts a shadow over everything we talk about. It is the children of WWII who are asked to go to Vietnam.
- Post WWI, we have a hightened sense of the US at its zenith.
- American exceptionalism: a grand narrative of US history after 1945. Defeat of totalitarianism, Nazi Germany, etc. Rebuilding of the ecnoy. A global reputation as a leader.
- Changing the global currency from the British pound to the US dollar. The UN is founded and located in NYC.
- Not simply -- the US as the greatest country in the world, but more importantly, the US and its people are not bound to historical trends and patterns which all other nations adn peoples are bound towards. The central claim of American exceptionalism. You can have coups and militant conflict, but we are these people  for whom the actions on the outside do not apply.
- Jan 6th -- this is not who we are, how could this happen here? We are this other group of people. This is now central to the story of American exceptionalism.
- Four narratives which underwrite post-1945 grad narratives of American exceptionalism: state and society, materialism, social liberation, and just war
- State and society
	- What is the relationship between civil society and the civilian?
	- Because of the origins in the US Constitution, our governmental system has design integrity against corrupt, incompetent individuals.
	- An incorruptability of the government
	- Assassinations, the Vietnam War, responses to civic protests, and **media coverage** destroyed the purity of the system. Thereafter Americans viewed the system as corrupted and elected officials as untrustworthy liars.
	- A nation so broken by the politics of the long 1960s.
	- Public trust in elected officials falls precipitously in the mid 60s.
	- Origin of the culture wars in Bill Clinton
	- high point in public trust after 9/11
	- All time low public trust currently.
	- Narrative of what happens between state and society? Our politics has been profoundly broken. 
- Materialism
	- Rivers catching on fire (Cuyahoga river fire, 1969)
	- Progressive nations, looking forward.
	- "the US has no history"
	- Fear of nuclear war, fallout, the world is falling -- the environment is collapsing. What is going to happen going forward?
	- The future is not necessarily better, and we see in this generation that the future indeed will pose large problems.
- Social liberation.
	- Civil rights -- we see the unacknowledged dominance of white men in society accepted
	- Generally normal, understood, and accepted.
	- "Good white people" (Malcolm X)
	- My life is my life, I'm not directly involved in oppression of black people: that's not my problem. An unchecked sense of superiority
	- Civil rights movements often conflict with each other: for instance there was a heavy dose of chauvanism running in the Black Panther Party.
- War.
	- Previous idea: America fights just wars and always wins.
	- Always in defense, never an aggressor
	- All problematic ideas. Why don't Ameircans know about the Phillipine war? Or much about the Korean war? Indigenous wars?
	- A source of shame emerged in the 1960s from Vietnam etc.: and a need to place **blame**. Who is to be blamed?
	- Americans aren't exceptional -- as demonstrated in Afghanistan.
	- The Civil War: different visions for the future; a radical abolitionist perspective, and also the ameleriorist vision which dominated and produced Jim Crow laws: America does not want to commit the Civil War to memory. Generations later, the Daughters of the Confederacy make the move to build the narrative of *lost cause*: the Confederates were still brave and noble men, just happening to be on the wrong side of the battle -- states rights, etc. 
	- What stories do we tell ourselves about what we are and where we came from?
	- The lost cause vision reinforces a white supremacist vision of America: rebirth of a nation.
	- Why were there so few executions after the Civil War? After the Dakota uprising, 38 Sioux leaders were hung. What kind of reconciliation did America settle with?
- Project idea: Understanding the relationship between analytic philosophers, educational institutions, and radical student movements in the 1960: precisely how analytic philosophy reconciled this with its political neutral and castrated philosophical position.

## Lecture 2: Last Shots, First Shots -- WWII and the New World Order
- Argument: WWII brought a sense that global order was needed to stave off another great conflagration in the future, but the emergence of the US and the Soviet Union as two great competing forces introduced a new destabilizing conflict. 
	- Brings about a desire for order, not only in the US and its allies but the USSR and similarly devastated countries -- a desire for order which conflicts between the US and the USSR, which attempt to impose a different form of order. This leads towards a contest for the mode of global order -- a new mode of destabilization. 
- Key terms -- don't think of them in an isolated way, understand how they fit together in a story.

### Part 1: Communism: A New Existential Threat
- Everything changes with WWII: a globally altering event.
- The US changes significantly: constantly imaging existential threats is something which starts in WWII -- a war against totalitarianism, will democracy survive? Confrontation with communism: the new existential threat
	- Nuclear war, threat to American system (capitalism, democracy, etc.)
- US war production
	- American working people help win the war: produced a lot of stuff used by Allies to win the war
	- American manufacturing sector grows significantly during WWII; US comes out not damaged but **built up**; Ford plants turned into making tanks. 
	- American manufacturing system changes the economic mode of the country.
	- Wages go up 68%, but cost of living comes up 28%; we now have an explosion of the American middle class. 
	- New Deal policies Roosevelt introduced help began a consolidation of power in the hands of large corporations, which cotinues throughout the war -- consolidation of farming, factory work, etc.
- Bretton Woods conference, 1944
	- World leaders get together and discuss econoics
	- Many trade barriers -- global economics stymied; greater free market system post-war.
	- More agreements for better trade exports, imports, etc.
	- Creationo f the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to help build up countreis from the war
	- Walter Lippman: 'father of Ameircan journalism' -- publishes *The New Republic*, 20th century as the American century
- Yalta Conference: Churchill, Roosevelt, Stalin; Potsdam: Atlay, Truman, Stalin
	- Begin talking about what to do with the rest of the world
	- Colonial possessions
	- Hemispheres of repirations -- USSR was heavily damaged, they want reparations. How to begin to recoop from the war.
	- What is the fate of Eastern Europe?
	- Truman becomes an interesting feature: weak foreign policy. Relies on many of his advisors, has many decisions to make. Deals with the situation developing in southeast Asia, etc. 
- US and Soviet troops meet at Elbe River in Germany (1945) -- both sides did try to make friends -- they had to. Tired from the war, no one wanted to keep on fighting. Everyone tried to make friends but theyw ere also fairly scared of each other at the same time.
- Stalin is an interestging figure: may be the worst mass murderer in all history. But his decisions really are quite moderate. He could have made more dictatorial positions but in fact what Stalin is doing in Eastern Europe after the war is trying to be conciliatory with the US and with Britain + the Allies. Although this does not last very long (only a few years) before large change. 
- Hiroshima and Nagasaki -- August 6 and 9, 1945. At least 145k civilians killed in 4 months
	- Signalling to the Russians that they were not going to get Japan
	- Usher in a new age of life: while it wants to control others' nuclear weapons, the US is the only country which has actuallye ver used them against civilian populations. 
	- Set off a new kind of international arms race: after some time many other countries have nuclear weapons
- WWII deaths -- Russia has had a major bloodletting in the Soviet Union; a large hand played in negotiations, they have suffered the most. Allies stopped in 1945 -- coudl have run further into Germany but hold back because Stalin wants soem of what's in Germany
	- 25m people in Soviet Union, China lost many civilians
	- United States: relatively small
- Russia as the 'sole great power on the Continent' -- area linking the black sea to the Mediterranean -- America wanted to make sure the Darnell strait was not something the Soviet could set up in, + shipping interests; also east and southeast asia become important areas of conflict
- US will back alkl of the colonial nations taking back their colonial possessions
	- Except Thailand, all of Asia was held by colonial powers
	- Occupation of Southern part of the korean peninsula and Japan
- China was in the middle of a large civil war
- Truman: really allowing the USSR to cast a big shadow. An unfortunate thing that there wasn't more clarity between America and the USSR
- US begcomes more interested in the Middle East: oil for security agreement with Saudi Arabia
	- Gets us interested in the middle east -- a linkage to oil.
	- FDR & King Abdulaziz on the USS Quincy, 1945
	- First modern, heavily mechanized armies. They eat a lot of oil: they need a large quantity of oil. The American economy now produces consumer goods with a large number of goods
- United Nations, 1945: New York, mission to collectively keep peace
	- Attempt to create a body which solves problems before they arise
	- To understand Germany with the eradication of Jews, there is an emerging term towards "human rights", which in fact had not been tossed around in international circles much before. This presents interesting problems for the US. What is the US record on human rights? The USSR gets great mileage by pointing at the American South and Black people. 
	- Truman: we are getting beat up at the UN over our civil rights record, we need to do something
	- Civil Rights: a push comes a lot from criticism during the Cold War who criticize us during the Cold War
- New Lexicon to the world: first, second, and third worlds -- a language which didn't exist before, but we now have this during the UN (1945)
	- Second order (Communism) is sort of done away now...
	- First and third world still returns
	- The language for this New Lexicon is a first world conception: first world people who thing about taxonomizing the world -- those who are like us and those who are not
	- This becomes a way to talk about people -- how do people talk about the world? WB, IMF -- targets, the 3rd world, to redirect consumer behavior towards American products
	- "development thesis" -- first world countries, wealthy countries of the world make large amounts of money from loans from the IMF and WB to go to the third world and build roads and dams which pay off well to the contractors but rarely solve third world problems
	- Not asking people in the third world what are you doing to solve your issues? Made money...
- Atomic energy commission (AEC) 
	- Looking at places to test more nuclear weapons. This nwill now be the critical dimension of the US military.
	- Turn to the South Pacific: some islands.
	- Choose the Marshall Islands: these are not empty, but like the removal of indigenous people, the US army goes in and moves them away so that they can test nuclear weapons after 1945
	- Large numbers of naval ships stay in the South Pacific -- chained animals to the deck to see what happens -- all theoretical physics.
	- If you read abuot the atmospheric tests, you will see that they are trying to understand the bombs -- the two bombs they tried in Japan were very different: culture of experimentation and testing, more efficient weapon building
	- These are fission bombs being tested; fusion happens in the Sun, but fission is going to be smaller. Hydrogen bombs are larger, use fusion
	- Operation Crossorads: Baker test at Bikini Atoll, Marshall Islands (1946)
	- Continues to fall into a hegemonic pattern of displacement
- Spread of Communism
	- A few places where there is no debate: Poland will be occupied by USSR, Stalin insisted on this
	- Bulgaria and Romania had worked with Germany but to be occupied byt he USSR
	- Czechoslovaki and Hungary had Free elections for a few years until in 1948 and 1949.
	- Communist nationalist resistance movements in other countries. 
	- What happens in Vietnam? Nationalists first, communists second
	- Cannot throw all countries (Albania, Yugoslavia, Korea, Vietnam, etc.) into just one communist movement -- 'international communism'
	- No distinction between nationalism, communism, socialism, etc. made by the US government
- George Kennan's "Long Telegram" (1946)
	- Kennan -- diplomat working in the Soviet Union
	- A telegram sent to the state government on what happens in the Soviet Union -- fears of capitalist encirclement leading to international manipulation, etc. Recommended the US identify the USSR as an enemy and begin strategic planning
	- Policy track: leads towards contingent steps in rising tensions, leads towards the Truman Doctrine, Marshall Plan, NSC-68: US policy of containment which gets the US into the Korean and Vietnam wars
- 1946, claim of post-WWII territory: an iron curtain has descended across the European continent. Dropping of an iron curtain behind which was only Soviet influence, not open to the free world.
	- 1946, Republicans gain both houses of congress, first since 1932.
	- Truman looked in trouble, but later wrote that this in fact freed him up. He felt freer, he could take bold action which hew anted to take anyway. Bold action on Civil Rights and the Cold War
- The Truman Doctrine (1947)
	- Lending of large amounts of money to places in the world such that they didn't fall under the influence of the Soviet Union
	- Military aid given to Turkey and Greece
	- Truman -- wanted to see Germany unified, currently divided across US, Britain, France, USSR
	- Marshall Plan: $13 billion given to European nations, again to resist Communist influence, staying within American realm
	- Policy of containment: putting in place new forms of aid and weaponry to push back the Soviets, to make sure Communism didn't spread
	- Belief of two worlds emerging -- one free, and one Moscovian
- McCarthyism and the Red Square -- late 1940s to mid 1950s
	- Senator Joseph McCarthy from Wisconsin made himself very well known by making accusations and suggestions that there were many communist subversives in the US political structure
	- Threw out this idea and it landed very well: people picked up on it and McCarthy really went after it -- had lists of who was a Communist
	- Freaked out the whole country about Comunists in our mist
	- Second Red Scare (after 1920s), became really dangerous to be accused of being a communist -- blacklisted from services, lose your job... agencies began working on it, FBI and CIA expanded massively (CIA relatively new) and begins to look into American behaviors, NSA emerges, AEC does secret tests on people in state-run facilities. Orphans with mental disabilities -- feeding radioactive food, etc. Peeking into private lives. This is where we get the great fear-mongering around homosexuality, which hadn't really been put down before.
	- Banning of homosexuals from military service (1949) -- homosexuality would be so shameful that it would make someone easy to be blackmailed
	- Not easy to be critical of nuclear testing, could get you accused of being a communist
	- mid 50s, people stopped taking McCarthy so serious, drunk himself to death
	- Fear of communism begins to erode American values -- people begin to register fear about what it means: what if Americans are spying on each other and giving away names, what does that mean for American values? What does our country stand for? Look at what Communism is doing for us as a nation?
- Communist China
	- Communists in China win the Civil War in 1949, nationalists move to Taiwan and mainland China is taken over under Mao Zedong
	- US had never possessed China but registered this as the loss of China: the divide of the world into 2, a zero-sum game: if we don't possess it, we've lost it
	- Fever pitch of American fears of communism -- communism would not march around the world!
	- Soviet Union tested their first nuclear device: now not the only ones holding nuclear weapons
	- NATO (1949) -- put Europe under the nuclear umbrella, to be guarded by American forces.
- NSC-68 and the policy of containment (1950)
	- NSC-68: US policy statement that the Cold War was an epic struggle between freedom and the slavery and grim oligarchy of communism
	- Foreign policy as an epic struggle between these two forces
	- USSR animtated by a fanatic faith to take over the world, aniothetically
	- Need to contain the USSR and not let it spread any further.
	- This leads us to containment, which leads the US to become mired in these wars
	- Means: US needs more money for infrastructure, tanks, etc. -- Americna taxpayers have a hefty bill to pay, people begin to worry about the taxes needed -- what does this mean to the US?; and new concrete policy direction
- By 1950, US is thinking about aid
	- Creation of Israel, military aid for Iran and Saudi Arabia, aid to all SE Asia nations, defense of Taiwan, etc. -- all a fear of Communism
	- Worried about nuclear disaster -- get under the desk and cover up, practicing for a nuclear war. 
	- Paradox of preparing to conront a totalitarian enemy -- what is the existential threat of communism doing to the country?
	- Might the US become a **garrison state**? -- a state which raises taxes, has a global military presence, peers into American lives, reorient what we mean by freedom
- A free nation as a world power: battling foreign influence without ruining the US -- ho to become a garrison state. 
- At this point where the US commits to global military dominance, begins with this sort of Communist scare
	- Eisenhower: beware the military industrial complex
- Hydrogen bomb, 1952. New interest in developing fusion bombs. First tested in 1952, another level of the Cold War and the arms race: begins metaphysical conversations about what is going on, what will happen int he world, etc. 10,400 vs 15 (atomic) kt of TNT.
	- What is man capable of? Doing what the sun has done?
	- The Atomic Cafe
	- People are very much kept in the dark -- atomic malaise which sets in
	- Something significant about the *hydrogen* in hydrogen bomb -- the smallest, most innocuous element
	- Oppenheimer, in charge of the WWII bombs, changes his tune, is later against hydrogen bombs. Should we build the hydrogen bomb? Create the fission explosino to make the fusion explosion. Oppenheimer: don't do it, we shouldn't open that door, leads you down this metaphysical existential pathway.
	- Caastle Bravo Test, Marshall Islands, 1954 -- exceeded the projected power by 2505, 1000x larger than the Hiroshima bomb. They don't really know what they are doing
- Fallout
	- Even though staked out an area to protect people, explosion was bigger and cut some people, including Japanese Fisherman "The Lucky Dragon", died of radioactive poisoning
	- Radioactive materials showed up in America's ports: radioactive tea, radioactive tuna: unleashing a massive public health problem

### Part 2: Battlefields of the Cold War
- Decolonization and the third world
- Major changes in WWII -- beginning of decolonization. The US had in 46 given Philippine Independence. US pressured GB to give up its colonies as well. Belief in the self determination of nations
- Philippines: Spanish then American then Japanese then American (1946)
- British Empire at its height held 1/4 of the globe
- India and Gandhi
	- Salt March to protest British salt monopoly 
	- Indian and Pakistani independence in 1947
	- Realization by colonized people that thei rresources are being extracted unjustly
	- The attempt to nationalize resources
	- Gandhi was interested in nonviolent tactics and will influence many leaders in the Civil Rights movement.
	- Byard Ruston -- not written in the history books because he was gay -- education of non-violent tactics into American civil rights.
- Korea: test of US containment policy
	- 1948 - 1950: became the focus point for an early cold war
	- Strategically unimportant; Americans know almost nothing about it and don't want to be involved in it. But needs to be a place which the US must stand up in. 
	- Korean War, 1950 - 1953: Kim Il Sung (communist-nationalist) and Syngman Rhee (anti-communist, authoritarian) -- Rhee not a great ally but this is what we got with
- Korean War: 1950, Communists attacked in the South and almost push UN forces out of the peninsula; then American forces come in and push Communist forces back into the South and almost go to the river; then 1951 Chinese come across the border and push the Americans back to the current obrder between north and south Korea. Fight over the DMZ.
- French in indochina -- want to come back. There is an anti-colonial revolution in Indochina. French in Indochina since 1858. Vietnamese communist resistance movement getting rid of the japanese, then the French -- not saviors, and do not want to open up to French colonization. US supported France even though it was counter to the self-determination beliefs
	- National Liberation Front, Viet Minh -- getting better at how to fight the French
	- Kennedy -- stopping wars of 'national liberation'
	- French and anti-communists in the South Vietnam: French-speaking Buddhists, didn't really respect their own population -- **not uncommon** in post-colonial societies.
	- The colonized leaders -- colonizers leave but new people who take over are not necessarily great
- French defeat by the Viet Minh at Dien Bien Phu, Indochina -- beat the French, battle which goes on (French set them up in a poor spot), Viet Minh forces came from all over until the French gave up
- What will the US do now? The French failure...
- Iran (1953)
	- Battlefield of the Cold War
	- Place with lots of resources and oil
	- Anglo-Iranian oil company (becomes BP) -- interested in connections with Iranian oilfields
	- Occupation of Iran? Soviet Union kept out of Iran by US
	- Iranians accept Mohammed Mossadegh ran on the premise of nationalizing Iranian oil -- giving Iranian oil to Iranians vs foreign policies.
	- Nationalization fo resources smacks like communism to American ears: British and American secret organizations installed the Shah Mohammed Pahlavi (old religious leader) as the leader -- got rid of Mossadegh, now had a Western-friendly nation to develop oil
- Suez Crisis (1956)
	- Middle East continued to be important
	- Nationalization of resource -- the Suez Canal in Egypt, Nasser (Egyption president) wanted to nationalize it for Egyptions
	- Israelis, British, and French invaded Egypt without informing the US
	- US settled the Suez crisis -- interest in the Suez Canal 
	- Eisenhower later sending 5000 Marines to Lebanon
- Guatemala (1954)
	- US interested in this palce where we have countries largely owned by the United Fruit Company (American fruit company which did well in latin America) -- held large amounts of land in almsot all land in central America.
	- A blight had hit the soil in the banana plantations and wiped out the bananas.
	- Land not being grown because of the soil blright, not being used -- poor Guatemalans are getting pissed.
	- Arbenz runs on land redistribution -- sounds pretty communist to Americans.
	- Jacobo Arbenz Guzman elected in 1951, nationalist, noncommunist
	- Installs a right-wing authoritarian dictator Carlos Castillos Armas who is friendly to the United States
- Latin American communists
	- Che Guavara -- living in Guatemala at the time. Ernesto "Che" Guevara
	- An important part of how communism gets to Cuba
	- Guevara & Castro
	- Go to a province in Cuba which had previously been dominated and find lots of angry Cuban peasants who don't like ending of communal land fields, etc. -- turning into exports, forced globalization
	- By 1959, US Americans controlled 75% of Cuba's arable land, ended community alndholdings
	- Cuba not held as a colony -- but still, Cuba could not trade with anyone other than the US -- Cuba became a sugar plantation.
	- Milton Hershey -- one of the pioneers of vertical integration -- own all the mechanisms of the production process, and therefore you ca make enormous profits. Cuba did great for Herhsey's profits
	- 1959, Cuban Revolution -- communists win in Cuba. Defeat the miitary forces, Baptiste (old President) flees to the US, Cuban exiles end up in Miami (people who later come back in Bay of Pigs invasion)
	- US: now we have a communist nation in the Western hemisphere, not too far from the United Sttes.
	- CIA begin to think of how to get rid of the communist government
- Space race and arms race
	- How to build on not only more nuclear weapons but other elements of the nuclear triad: land-based missiles, bombers, submarines
	- Burgenoning space race, 1957 -- Soviets succeeded in getting Sputnik going around -- about the size of a large basketball -- Soviet-made object was circling over their heads
	- Soviets leading the world in rocketry -- what is the SOviets develop better rockets?
	- Bomber gap, missile gap -- possible development of a garrison state
	- Stalin -- anyone who spent time around the West were dangerous -- former Soviet soldiers, straight to the Gulag
- Mutually assured destruction
	- Secretary of State Dulles, massive retaliation
	- Allan Dulles: head of the CIA, Dulles brothers cast a large shadow
		- Involved in many coups
	- American strategy: massive retaliation and mutually assured destruction
	- US would have such a large stockpile that they could deliver a massive retaliation if the Soviets attacked anywhere in the world.
	- Deterrence theory
	- As people began to point out, what does MAD really mean? We will blow each other up, what sense does this make? A free society which will build large stockpiles and take large taxes, but to use it is to lose -- they will never be used. Their function is to sit there and wait; they serve as a deterrent. Nuclear madness -- no one wants to fire one, and yet the investment into fiction -- negative force.
- Capitalism breeds mediocrity -- they have to be largely palatable.
	- Our bananas are unflavorable lol

## Lecture 3: The Ongoing Struggle for Civil Rights
- Argument: WWII changed the conversation over civil rights by placing the US in a struggle for human freedom. The war's outcome and the meanings of the Cold War empowered new leaders, spurred new efforts, led to new tactics that advanced civil rights in America

Part I
- What new role will the US play in race relations?
- The great depression and the new deal (1930s)
	- Paul Robeson -- someone who has a prevoius relationship to the Soviet Union -- is blacklisted from Hollywood, cannot perform because he was seent o have Communist sympathies. 
	- Changes from the 1930s to the 1950s: in the 1930s, the New Deal was an attempt to alleviate the problems of the stock market crash and the crisis of capitalism in the Great Depression -- New Deal policies were heavily discriminatory
		- It's easy to think that the federal government wrote discriminatory policies
		- Rarely deos the federal government at this time strictly discriminate
		- Instead, the way to sell these to Americans is that the federal policy money is locally administered -- local people can put their own spin on the policy -- hire people where you want or need them
		- The New Deal by this fashion ends up being discriminatory -- excludes Black people. 
	- Popular front: coalition of working class people who are trying to fix problems in America, and to bring in influences from the far left. What emerges is a coalition of laborers -- a time to help out the little guy, the working man, the popular front. Turns into an acceptance of ethnic groups which previously haven't been accepted (Italians, Jews, Catholics). 
	- Communist party plays an important rule here because it's the only group in America doing anything about race -- specifically challenges the US on issueus of race.
	- Communist party says that race and gender are tools of capitalism. The CP is trying to take actions on race
	- Highly publicized cases
		- Scottsboro case 1931 -- 9 young black men are accused of rape by two white women. Both of the women will recant it. But it has implications for the Supreme Case
		- Powell v Alabama (1932) -- the young men never got any kind of good representation
		- Norris v Alabama (1935) -- systemic exclusion of Black people from juries
		- Scottsboro case is one of the most important court cases which opens peoples' eyes to systemic problems in the criminal justice system
	- CIO -- labor union which comes in the model of the old IWW. IWW was important because they would organize everyone. Many other labor unions were historically very discriminatory (e.g. AFL). The CIO with the CP begin to challenge race lines, bring in more black people inot labor unions
	- Ongoing segregation in the South, lynching had not lessenned. 
- 1941 lend-lease act
	- WW2 is important for what happens to Civil Rights because the US begins to produce a lot of stuff
	- Many jobs are union jobs with good pay
	- America begins to send stuff to all manner of items
	- The US already produces a lot of stuff
- "Arsenal of democracy": US War Production 1940 - 45
	- The US creates huge amounts of stuff to win the war
	- Domestic stuff: cigarette manufacturers got declared as a necessary sector of the economy 
	- Unified effort in WW2 to win -- a lot of work, jobs, and production
- FDR and selling the war
	- Four Freedoms speech (1941) 
	- The US were before very isolationist -- American First committee who did not want to go to war, America should stay out of Europe
	- FDR working on how to sell the ar to the United States
	- Four Freedoms speech visualized by Norman Rockwell
	- Freedom of speech, worship, from fear, from want.
	- Need for national stories: this is a national story, ths is who we are
	- Atlantic Charter: belief in making a pact with European Allies will help bring a world-safer democracy
- A Philip Randolph
	- Black people still very much held apart from this national unity
	- As 'interior others' -- still being othered, interior ro the nation (provide a lot of labor) but still held as seocnd-class citizens
	- 1941, Roosevelt is trying to get Americans to see they are on the same page
	- Black people know they are not unified
	- A Philip Randolph, head of union of black pullman car porters -- threatened a massive Civil Rights demonstration in DC
	- Let Roosevelt knew in this moment of attempted unity that black workers would hold a massive demonstration to show just how ununited the country was -- the last thing FDR wanted
	- From A Philip Randolph's pressure, Roosevelt had to make important policy concessions
	- Creationo f the Fair Employment Practices Commission (1941 - 1946): investigate labor conditions in war industries
	- There remained ways to discriminate: unions, pay, conditions, etc. -- Black people not allowed to be in 'skilled' positions -- last hired, first fired
	- 1942, Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) -- important Black Civil Rights organization which will continue to play an important role throughout
	- Urban league in 1909, 1910 -- growing rights organizations
- Double V for Victory -- Victory at home over racism and Victory abroad over totalitarianism
- Second Great Migration -- many white AMeicans begin to see it differently after many black people move out of the South in WW2 to take new jobs in western and northern manufacturing jobs. (First Great Migration happens in WWI). 
	- Southernization of American culture -- take and spread culture
