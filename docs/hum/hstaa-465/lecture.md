## Lecture 1: The 1960s -- A Crisis of National Unity
Unfortunately my notes previously were lost because my computer lost battery and GitHub was stalling :(

- What is meant by consensus? Enough to provide definitiona nd form to the dominant culture
- Consensus over what? What was broken? What happens to the stories which hold the US together?
- American exceptionalism: the grand narrative of US history
- The acceptnace of New Deal liberalism
- WWII entirely changes the coordinates
- High unemployment in the US
- The US is built up by WWII -- the world's leading manufacturing econoy, an explosion of the middle class. WWII shapes everything. The monolith of WWII casts a shadow over everything we talk about. It is the children of WWII who are asked to go to Vietnam.
- Post WWI, we have a hightened sense of the US at its zenith.
- American exceptionalism: a grand narrative of US history after 1945. Defeat of totalitarianism, Nazi Germany, etc. Rebuilding of the ecnoy. A global reputation as a leader.
- Changing the global currency from the British pound to the US dollar. The UN is founded and located in NYC.
- Not simply -- the US as the greatest country in the world, but more importantly, the US and its people are not bound to historical trends and patterns which all other nations adn peoples are bound towards. The central claim of American exceptionalism. You can have coups and militant conflict, but we are these people  for whom the actions on the outside do not apply.
- Jan 6th -- this is not who we are, how could this happen here? We are this other group of people. This is now central to the story of American exceptionalism.
- Four narratives which underwrite post-1945 grad narratives of American exceptionalism: state and society, materialism, social liberation, and just war
- State and society
	- What is the relationship between civil society and the civilian?
	- Because of the origins in the US Constitution, our governmental system has design integrity against corrupt, incompetent individuals.
	- An incorruptability of the government
	- Assassinations, the Vietnam War, responses to civic protests, and **media coverage** destroyed the purity of the system. Thereafter Americans viewed the system as corrupted and elected officials as untrustworthy liars.
	- A nation so broken by the politics of the long 1960s.
	- Public trust in elected officials falls precipitously in the mid 60s.
	- Origin of the culture wars in Bill Clinton
	- high point in public trust after 9/11
	- All time low public trust currently.
	- Narrative of what happens between state and society? Our politics has been profoundly broken. 
- Materialism
	- Rivers catching on fire (Cuyahoga river fire, 1969)
	- Progressive nations, looking forward.
	- "the US has no history"
	- Fear of nuclear war, fallout, the world is falling -- the environment is collapsing. What is going to happen going forward?
	- The future is not necessarily better, and we see in this generation that the future indeed will pose large problems.
- Social liberation.
	- Civil rights -- we see the unacknowledged dominance of white men in society accepted
	- Generally normal, understood, and accepted.
	- "Good white people" (Malcolm X)
	- My life is my life, I'm not directly involved in oppression of black people: that's not my problem. An unchecked sense of superiority
	- Civil rights movements often conflict with each other: for instance there was a heavy dose of chauvanism running in the Black Panther Party.
- War.
	- Previous idea: America fights just wars and always wins.
	- Always in defense, never an aggressor
	- All problematic ideas. Why don't Ameircans know about the Phillipine war? Or much about the Korean war? Indigenous wars?
	- A source of shame emerged in the 1960s from Vietnam etc.: and a need to place **blame**. Who is to be blamed?
	- Americans aren't exceptional -- as demonstrated in Afghanistan.
	- The Civil War: different visions for the future; a radical abolitionist perspective, and also the ameleriorist vision which dominated and produced Jim Crow laws: America does not want to commit the Civil War to memory. Generations later, the Daughters of the Confederacy make the move to build the narrative of *lost cause*: the Confederates were still brave and noble men, just happening to be on the wrong side of the battle -- states rights, etc. 
	- What stories do we tell ourselves about what we are and where we came from?
	- The lost cause vision reinforces a white supremacist vision of America: rebirth of a nation.
	- Why were there so few executions after the Civil War? After the Dakota uprising, 38 Sioux leaders were hung. What kind of reconciliation did America settle with?
- Project idea: Understanding the relationship between analytic philosophers, educational institutions, and radical student movements in the 1960: precisely how analytic philosophy reconciled this with its political neutral and castrated philosophical position.

## Lecture 2: Last Shots, First Shots -- WWII and the New World Order
- Argument: WWII brought a sense that global order was needed to stave off another great conflagration in the future, but the emergence of the US and the Soviet Union as two great competing forces introduced a new destabilizing conflict. 
	- Brings about a desire for order, not only in the US and its allies but the USSR and similarly devastated countries -- a desire for order which conflicts between the US and the USSR, which attempt to impose a different form of order. This leads towards a contest for the mode of global order -- a new mode of destabilization. 
- Key terms -- don't think of them in an isolated way, understand how they fit together in a story.

### Part 1: Communism: A New Existential Threat
- Everything changes with WWII: a globally altering event.
- The US changes significantly: constantly imaging existential threats is something which starts in WWII -- a war against totalitarianism, will democracy survive? Confrontation with communism: the new existential threat
	- Nuclear war, threat to American system (capitalism, democracy, etc.)
- US war production
	- American working people help win the war: produced a lot of stuff used by Allies to win the war
	- American manufacturing sector grows significantly during WWII; US comes out not damaged but **built up**; Ford plants turned into making tanks. 
	- American manufacturing system changes the economic mode of the country.
	- Wages go up 68%, but cost of living comes up 28%; we now have an explosion of the American middle class. 
	- New Deal policies Roosevelt introduced help began a consolidation of power in the hands of large corporations, which cotinues throughout the war -- consolidation of farming, factory work, etc.
- Bretton Woods conference, 1944
	- World leaders get together and discuss econoics
	- Many trade barriers -- global economics stymied; greater free market system post-war.
	- More agreements for better trade exports, imports, etc.
	- Creationo f the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to help build up countreis from the war
	- Walter Lippman: 'father of Ameircan journalism' -- publishes *The New Republic*, 20th century as the American century
- Yalta Conference: Churchill, Roosevelt, Stalin; Potsdam: Atlay, Truman, Stalin
	- Begin talking about what to do with the rest of the world
	- Colonial possessions
	- Hemispheres of repirations -- USSR was heavily damaged, they want reparations. How to begin to recoop from the war.
	- What is the fate of Eastern Europe?
	- Truman becomes an interesting feature: weak foreign policy. Relies on many of his advisors, has many decisions to make. Deals with the situation developing in southeast Asia, etc. 
- US and Soviet troops meet at Elbe River in Germany (1945) -- both sides did try to make friends -- they had to. Tired from the war, no one wanted to keep on fighting. Everyone tried to make friends but theyw ere also fairly scared of each other at the same time.
- Stalin is an interestging figure: may be the worst mass murderer in all history. But his decisions really are quite moderate. He could have made more dictatorial positions but in fact what Stalin is doing in Eastern Europe after the war is trying to be conciliatory with the US and with Britain + the Allies. Although this does not last very long (only a few years) before large change. 
- Hiroshima and Nagasaki -- August 6 and 9, 1945. At least 145k civilians killed in 4 months
	- Signalling to the Russians that they were not going to get Japan
	- Usher in a new age of life: while it wants to control others' nuclear weapons, the US is the only country which has actuallye ver used them against civilian populations. 
	- Set off a new kind of international arms race: after some time many other countries have nuclear weapons
- WWII deaths -- Russia has had a major bloodletting in the Soviet Union; a large hand played in negotiations, they have suffered the most. Allies stopped in 1945 -- coudl have run further into Germany but hold back because Stalin wants soem of what's in Germany
	- 25m people in Soviet Union, China lost many civilians
	- United States: relatively small
- Russia as the 'sole great power on the Continent' -- area linking the black sea to the Mediterranean -- America wanted to make sure the Darnell strait was not something the Soviet could set up in, + shipping interests; also east and southeast asia become important areas of conflict
- US will back alkl of the colonial nations taking back their colonial possessions
	- Except Thailand, all of Asia was held by colonial powers
	- Occupation of Southern part of the korean peninsula and Japan
- China was in the middle of a large civil war
- Truman: really allowing the USSR to cast a big shadow. An unfortunate thing that there wasn't more clarity between America and the USSR
- US begcomes more interested in the Middle East: oil for security agreement with Saudi Arabia
	- Gets us interested in the middle east -- a linkage to oil.
	- FDR & King Abdulaziz on the USS Quincy, 1945
	- First modern, heavily mechanized armies. They eat a lot of oil: they need a large quantity of oil. The American economy now produces consumer goods with a large number of goods
- United Nations, 1945: New York, mission to collectively keep peace
	- Attempt to create a body which solves problems before they arise
	- To understand Germany with the eradication of Jews, there is an emerging term towards "human rights", which in fact had not been tossed around in international circles much before. This presents interesting problems for the US. What is the US record on human rights? The USSR gets great mileage by pointing at the American South and Black people. 
	- Truman: we are getting beat up at the UN over our civil rights record, we need to do something
	- Civil Rights: a push comes a lot from criticism during the Cold War who criticize us during the Cold War
- New Lexicon to the world: first, second, and third worlds -- a language which didn't exist before, but we now have this during the UN (1945)
	- Second order (Communism) is sort of done away now...
	- First and third world still returns
	- The language for this New Lexicon is a first world conception: first world people who thing about taxonomizing the world -- those who are like us and those who are not
	- This becomes a way to talk about people -- how do people talk about the world? WB, IMF -- targets, the 3rd world, to redirect consumer behavior towards American products
	- "development thesis" -- first world countries, wealthy countries of the world make large amounts of money from loans from the IMF and WB to go to the third world and build roads and dams which pay off well to the contractors but rarely solve third world problems
	- Not asking people in the third world what are you doing to solve your issues? Made money...
- Atomic energy commission (AEC) 
	- Looking at places to test more nuclear weapons. This nwill now be the critical dimension of the US military.
	- Turn to the South Pacific: some islands.
	- Choose the Marshall Islands: these are not empty, but like the removal of indigenous people, the US army goes in and moves them away so that they can test nuclear weapons after 1945
	- Large numbers of naval ships stay in the South Pacific -- chained animals to the deck to see what happens -- all theoretical physics.
	- If you read abuot the atmospheric tests, you will see that they are trying to understand the bombs -- the two bombs they tried in Japan were very different: culture of experimentation and testing, more efficient weapon building
	- These are fission bombs being tested; fusion happens in the Sun, but fission is going to be smaller. Hydrogen bombs are larger, use fusion
	- Operation Crossorads: Baker test at Bikini Atoll, Marshall Islands (1946)
	- Continues to fall into a hegemonic pattern of displacement
- Spread of Communism
	- A few places where there is no debate: Poland will be occupied by USSR, Stalin insisted on this
	- Bulgaria and Romania had worked with Germany but to be occupied byt he USSR
	- Czechoslovaki and Hungary had Free elections for a few years until in 1948 and 1949.
	- Communist nationalist resistance movements in other countries. 
	- What happens in Vietnam? Nationalists first, communists second
	- Cannot throw all countries (Albania, Yugoslavia, Korea, Vietnam, etc.) into just one communist movement -- 'international communism'
	- No distinction between nationalism, communism, socialism, etc. made by the US government
- George Kennan's "Long Telegram" (1946)
	- Kennan -- diplomat working in the Soviet Union
	- A telegram sent to the state government on what happens in the Soviet Union -- fears of capitalist encirclement leading to international manipulation, etc. Recommended the US identify the USSR as an enemy and begin strategic planning
	- Policy track: leads towards contingent steps in rising tensions, leads towards the Truman Doctrine, Marshall Plan, NSC-68: US policy of containment which gets the US into the Korean and Vietnam wars
- 1946, claim of post-WWII territory: an iron curtain has descended across the European continent. Dropping of an iron curtain behind which was only Soviet influence, not open to the free world.
	- 1946, Republicans gain both houses of congress, first since 1932.
	- Truman looked in trouble, but later wrote that this in fact freed him up. He felt freer, he could take bold action which hew anted to take anyway. Bold action on Civil Rights and the Cold War
- The Truman Doctrine (1947)
	- Lending of large amounts of money to places in the world such that they didn't fall under the influence of the Soviet Union
	- Military aid given to Turkey and Greece
	- Truman -- wanted to see Germany unified, currently divided across US, Britain, France, USSR
	- Marshall Plan: $13 billion given to European nations, again to resist Communist influence, staying within American realm
	- Policy of containment: putting in place new forms of aid and weaponry to push back the Soviets, to make sure Communism didn't spread
	- Belief of two worlds emerging -- one free, and one Moscovian
- McCarthyism and the Red Square -- late 1940s to mid 1950s
	- Senator Joseph McCarthy from Wisconsin made himself very well known by making accusations and suggestions that there were many communist subversives in the US political structure
	- Threw out this idea and it landed very well: people picked up on it and McCarthy really went after it -- had lists of who was a Communist
	- Freaked out the whole country about Comunists in our mist
	- Second Red Scare (after 1920s), became really dangerous to be accused of being a communist -- blacklisted from services, lose your job... agencies began working on it, FBI and CIA expanded massively (CIA relatively new) and begins to look into American behaviors, NSA emerges, AEC does secret tests on people in state-run facilities. Orphans with mental disabilities -- feeding radioactive food, etc. Peeking into private lives. This is where we get the great fear-mongering around homosexuality, which hadn't really been put down before.
	- Banning of homosexuals from military service (1949) -- homosexuality would be so shameful that it would make someone easy to be blackmailed
	- Not easy to be critical of nuclear testing, could get you accused of being a communist
	- mid 50s, people stopped taking McCarthy so serious, drunk himself to death
	- Fear of communism begins to erode American values -- people begin to register fear about what it means: what if Americans are spying on each other and giving away names, what does that mean for American values? What does our country stand for? Look at what Communism is doing for us as a nation?
- Communist China
	- Communists in China win the Civil War in 1949, nationalists move to Taiwan and mainland China is taken over under Mao Zedong
	- US had never possessed China but registered this as the loss of China: the divide of the world into 2, a zero-sum game: if we don't possess it, we've lost it
	- Fever pitch of American fears of communism -- communism would not march around the world!
	- Soviet Union tested their first nuclear device: now not the only ones holding nuclear weapons
	- NATO (1949) -- put Europe under the nuclear umbrella, to be guarded by American forces.
- NSC-68 and the policy of containment (1950)
	- NSC-68: US policy statement that the Cold War was an epic struggle between freedom and the slavery and grim oligarchy of communism
	- Foreign policy as an epic struggle between these two forces
	- USSR animtated by a fanatic faith to take over the world, aniothetically
	- Need to contain the USSR and not let it spread any further.
	- This leads us to containment, which leads the US to become mired in these wars
	- Means: US needs more money for infrastructure, tanks, etc. -- Americna taxpayers have a hefty bill to pay, people begin to worry about the taxes needed -- what does this mean to the US?; and new concrete policy direction
- By 1950, US is thinking about aid
	- Creation of Israel, military aid for Iran and Saudi Arabia, aid to all SE Asia nations, defense of Taiwan, etc. -- all a fear of Communism
	- Worried about nuclear disaster -- get under the desk and cover up, practicing for a nuclear war. 
	- Paradox of preparing to conront a totalitarian enemy -- what is the existential threat of communism doing to the country?
	- Might the US become a **garrison state**? -- a state which raises taxes, has a global military presence, peers into American lives, reorient what we mean by freedom
- A free nation as a world power: battling foreign influence without ruining the US -- ho to become a garrison state. 
- At this point where the US commits to global military dominance, begins with this sort of Communist scare
	- Eisenhower: beware the military industrial complex
- Hydrogen bomb, 1952. New interest in developing fusion bombs. First tested in 1952, another level of the Cold War and the arms race: begins metaphysical conversations about what is going on, what will happen int he world, etc. 10,400 vs 15 (atomic) kt of TNT.
	- What is man capable of? Doing what the sun has done?
	- The Atomic Cafe
	- People are very much kept in the dark -- atomic malaise which sets in
	- Something significant about the *hydrogen* in hydrogen bomb -- the smallest, most innocuous element
	- Oppenheimer, in charge of the WWII bombs, changes his tune, is later against hydrogen bombs. Should we build the hydrogen bomb? Create the fission explosino to make the fusion explosion. Oppenheimer: don't do it, we shouldn't open that door, leads you down this metaphysical existential pathway.
	- Caastle Bravo Test, Marshall Islands, 1954 -- exceeded the projected power by 2505, 1000x larger than the Hiroshima bomb. They don't really know what they are doing
- Fallout
	- Even though staked out an area to protect people, explosion was bigger and cut some people, including Japanese Fisherman "The Lucky Dragon", died of radioactive poisoning
	- Radioactive materials showed up in America's ports: radioactive tea, radioactive tuna: unleashing a massive public health problem

### Part 2: Battlefields of the Cold War
- Decolonization and the third world
- Major changes in WWII -- beginning of decolonization. The US had in 46 given Philippine Independence. US pressured GB to give up its colonies as well. Belief in the self determination of nations
- Philippines: Spanish then American then Japanese then American (1946)
- British Empire at its height held 1/4 of the globe
- India and Gandhi
	- Salt March to protest British salt monopoly 
	- Indian and Pakistani independence in 1947
	- Realization by colonized people that thei rresources are being extracted unjustly
	- The attempt to nationalize resources
	- Gandhi was interested in nonviolent tactics and will influence many leaders in the Civil Rights movement.
	- Byard Ruston -- not written in the history books because he was gay -- education of non-violent tactics into American civil rights.
- Korea: test of US containment policy
	- 1948 - 1950: became the focus point for an early cold war
	- Strategically unimportant; Americans know almost nothing about it and don't want to be involved in it. But needs to be a place which the US must stand up in. 
	- Korean War, 1950 - 1953: Kim Il Sung (communist-nationalist) and Syngman Rhee (anti-communist, authoritarian) -- Rhee not a great ally but this is what we got with
- Korean War: 1950, Communists attacked in the South and almost push UN forces out of the peninsula; then American forces come in and push Communist forces back into the South and almost go to the river; then 1951 Chinese come across the border and push the Americans back to the current obrder between north and south Korea. Fight over the DMZ.
- French in indochina -- want to come back. There is an anti-colonial revolution in Indochina. French in Indochina since 1858. Vietnamese communist resistance movement getting rid of the japanese, then the French -- not saviors, and do not want to open up to French colonization. US supported France even though it was counter to the self-determination beliefs
	- National Liberation Front, Viet Minh -- getting better at how to fight the French
	- Kennedy -- stopping wars of 'national liberation'
	- French and anti-communists in the South Vietnam: French-speaking Buddhists, didn't really respect their own population -- **not uncommon** in post-colonial societies.
	- The colonized leaders -- colonizers leave but new people who take over are not necessarily great
- French defeat by the Viet Minh at Dien Bien Phu, Indochina -- beat the French, battle which goes on (French set them up in a poor spot), Viet Minh forces came from all over until the French gave up
- What will the US do now? The French failure...
- Iran (1953)
	- Battlefield of the Cold War
	- Place with lots of resources and oil
	- Anglo-Iranian oil company (becomes BP) -- interested in connections with Iranian oilfields
	- Occupation of Iran? Soviet Union kept out of Iran by US
	- Iranians accept Mohammed Mossadegh ran on the premise of nationalizing Iranian oil -- giving Iranian oil to Iranians vs foreign policies.
	- Nationalization fo resources smacks like communism to American ears: British and American secret organizations installed the Shah Mohammed Pahlavi (old religious leader) as the leader -- got rid of Mossadegh, now had a Western-friendly nation to develop oil
- Suez Crisis (1956)
	- Middle East continued to be important
	- Nationalization of resource -- the Suez Canal in Egypt, Nasser (Egyption president) wanted to nationalize it for Egyptions
	- Israelis, British, and French invaded Egypt without informing the US
	- US settled the Suez crisis -- interest in the Suez Canal 
	- Eisenhower later sending 5000 Marines to Lebanon
- Guatemala (1954)
	- US interested in this palce where we have countries largely owned by the United Fruit Company (American fruit company which did well in latin America) -- held large amounts of land in almsot all land in central America.
	- A blight had hit the soil in the banana plantations and wiped out the bananas.
	- Land not being grown because of the soil blright, not being used -- poor Guatemalans are getting pissed.
	- Arbenz runs on land redistribution -- sounds pretty communist to Americans.
	- Jacobo Arbenz Guzman elected in 1951, nationalist, noncommunist
	- Installs a right-wing authoritarian dictator Carlos Castillos Armas who is friendly to the United States
- Latin American communists
	- Che Guavara -- living in Guatemala at the time. Ernesto "Che" Guevara
	- An important part of how communism gets to Cuba
	- Guevara & Castro
	- Go to a province in Cuba which had previously been dominated and find lots of angry Cuban peasants who don't like ending of communal land fields, etc. -- turning into exports, forced globalization
	- By 1959, US Americans controlled 75% of Cuba's arable land, ended community alndholdings
	- Cuba not held as a colony -- but still, Cuba could not trade with anyone other than the US -- Cuba became a sugar plantation.
	- Milton Hershey -- one of the pioneers of vertical integration -- own all the mechanisms of the production process, and therefore you ca make enormous profits. Cuba did great for Herhsey's profits
	- 1959, Cuban Revolution -- communists win in Cuba. Defeat the miitary forces, Baptiste (old President) flees to the US, Cuban exiles end up in Miami (people who later come back in Bay of Pigs invasion)
	- US: now we have a communist nation in the Western hemisphere, not too far from the United Sttes.
	- CIA begin to think of how to get rid of the communist government
- Space race and arms race
	- How to build on not only more nuclear weapons but other elements of the nuclear triad: land-based missiles, bombers, submarines
	- Burgenoning space race, 1957 -- Soviets succeeded in getting Sputnik going around -- about the size of a large basketball -- Soviet-made object was circling over their heads
	- Soviets leading the world in rocketry -- what is the SOviets develop better rockets?
	- Bomber gap, missile gap -- possible development of a garrison state
	- Stalin -- anyone who spent time around the West were dangerous -- former Soviet soldiers, straight to the Gulag
- Mutually assured destruction
	- Secretary of State Dulles, massive retaliation
	- Allan Dulles: head of the CIA, Dulles brothers cast a large shadow
		- Involved in many coups
	- American strategy: massive retaliation and mutually assured destruction
	- US would have such a large stockpile that they could deliver a massive retaliation if the Soviets attacked anywhere in the world.
	- Deterrence theory
	- As people began to point out, what does MAD really mean? We will blow each other up, what sense does this make? A free society which will build large stockpiles and take large taxes, but to use it is to lose -- they will never be used. Their function is to sit there and wait; they serve as a deterrent. Nuclear madness -- no one wants to fire one, and yet the investment into fiction -- negative force.
- Capitalism breeds mediocrity -- they have to be largely palatable.
	- Our bananas are unflavorable lol

## Lecture 3: The Ongoing Struggle for Civil Rights
- Argument: WWII changed the conversation over civil rights by placing the US in a struggle for human freedom. The war's outcome and the meanings of the Cold War empowered new leaders, spurred new efforts, led to new tactics that advanced civil rights in America

Part I
- What new role will the US play in race relations?
- The great depression and the new deal (1930s)
	- Paul Robeson -- someone who has a prevoius relationship to the Soviet Union -- is blacklisted from Hollywood, cannot perform because he was seent o have Communist sympathies. 
	- Changes from the 1930s to the 1950s: in the 1930s, the New Deal was an attempt to alleviate the problems of the stock market crash and the crisis of capitalism in the Great Depression -- New Deal policies were heavily discriminatory
		- It's easy to think that the federal government wrote discriminatory policies
		- Rarely deos the federal government at this time strictly discriminate
		- Instead, the way to sell these to Americans is that the federal policy money is locally administered -- local people can put their own spin on the policy -- hire people where you want or need them
		- The New Deal by this fashion ends up being discriminatory -- excludes Black people. 
	- Popular front: coalition of working class people who are trying to fix problems in America, and to bring in influences from the far left. What emerges is a coalition of laborers -- a time to help out the little guy, the working man, the popular front. Turns into an acceptance of ethnic groups which previously haven't been accepted (Italians, Jews, Catholics). 
	- Communist party plays an important rule here because it's the only group in America doing anything about race -- specifically challenges the US on issueus of race.
	- Communist party says that race and gender are tools of capitalism. The CP is trying to take actions on race
	- Highly publicized cases
		- Scottsboro case 1931 -- 9 young black men are accused of rape by two white women. Both of the women will recant it. But it has implications for the Supreme Case
		- Powell v Alabama (1932) -- the young men never got any kind of good representation
		- Norris v Alabama (1935) -- systemic exclusion of Black people from juries
		- Scottsboro case is one of the most important court cases which opens peoples' eyes to systemic problems in the criminal justice system
	- CIO -- labor union which comes in the model of the old IWW. IWW was important because they would organize everyone. Many other labor unions were historically very discriminatory (e.g. AFL). The CIO with the CP begin to challenge race lines, bring in more black people inot labor unions
	- Ongoing segregation in the South, lynching had not lessenned. 
- 1941 lend-lease act
	- WW2 is important for what happens to Civil Rights because the US begins to produce a lot of stuff
	- Many jobs are union jobs with good pay
	- America begins to send stuff to all manner of items
	- The US already produces a lot of stuff
- "Arsenal of democracy": US War Production 1940 - 45
	- The US creates huge amounts of stuff to win the war
	- Domestic stuff: cigarette manufacturers got declared as a necessary sector of the economy 
	- Unified effort in WW2 to win -- a lot of work, jobs, and production
- FDR and selling the war
	- Four Freedoms speech (1941) 
	- The US were before very isolationist -- American First committee who did not want to go to war, America should stay out of Europe
	- FDR working on how to sell the ar to the United States
	- Four Freedoms speech visualized by Norman Rockwell
	- Freedom of speech, worship, from fear, from want.
	- Need for national stories: this is a national story, ths is who we are
	- Atlantic Charter: belief in making a pact with European Allies will help bring a world-safer democracy
- A Philip Randolph
	- Black people still very much held apart from this national unity
	- As 'interior others' -- still being othered, interior ro the nation (provide a lot of labor) but still held as seocnd-class citizens
	- 1941, Roosevelt is trying to get Americans to see they are on the same page
	- Black people know they are not unified
	- A Philip Randolph, head of union of black pullman car porters -- threatened a massive Civil Rights demonstration in DC
	- Let Roosevelt knew in this moment of attempted unity that black workers would hold a massive demonstration to show just how ununited the country was -- the last thing FDR wanted
	- From A Philip Randolph's pressure, Roosevelt had to make important policy concessions
	- Creationo f the Fair Employment Practices Commission (1941 - 1946): investigate labor conditions in war industries
	- There remained ways to discriminate: unions, pay, conditions, etc. -- Black people not allowed to be in 'skilled' positions -- last hired, first fired
	- 1942, Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) -- important Black Civil Rights organization which will continue to play an important role throughout
	- Urban league in 1909, 1910 -- growing rights organizations
- Double V for Victory -- Victory at home over racism and Victory abroad over totalitarianism
- Second Great Migration -- many white AMeicans begin to see it differently after many black people move out of the South in WW2 to take new jobs in western and northern manufacturing jobs. (First Great Migration happens in WWI). 
	- Southernization of American culture -- take and spread culture
- Blacks during wartime
	- Northerns and Westererners don't want then there either -- a problem with the entire country

	- New situation that white Americans are encountering
- 1943, racial unrest in 34 CS cities
	- Race riots between white and black
	- Affter the frist great migration, we got the rise of a new KKK (first comes after Civil Rights to fight against northerners coming into the South, but became defunt with new segregation laws -- no need for a campaign of terror). Not a Southern entity at all -- a KKK of the north and the west (biggest chapters in Oregon, Indiana, Iowa, etc.). Not entirely new but now on a  new scale.
	- A new focus: united
- Wartime industrial jobs
	- Changes going on in the workplace

- Blacks and military service
	- Until 1948, segregated units
	- Most Black people serve in segregated units with specific types of jobs -- truck drivers, barbers, cooks
	- Limits to the GI Bill -- the GI BIll is a major change to American life because of WW2 and FDR type policies
	- The GI Bill
	- Homeowner's loan corporation -- begins to remake the industry
	- Federal government is involved in giving out home loans, and changes the industry because it forces the private mortgage industry to come down on elements of the mortgage. The American middle class expands enormously and more people can buy homes.
	- In fact quite good for capitalism, because no the consumer class grows
	- part of a change over to a consumer economy
	- GI Bill -- millions of Americans can get zero percent down loan with zero percent interest to build a farm, go to college, buy a house, etc. -- many could not do so before, now can
	- Same kinds of racial restrictions are in place -- local restriction
- The Bracero Program (1942 - 1964)

	- 22 million people or so moving across the border to work -- generation of this sort of movement even helps explain today's population
	- Employers get used to hiring certain kinds of workers and laborers
- Zoot Suit Riots, LA (1943)
	- Zoot suit -- long jacket flamboyant suit, sometimes with flashy colors -- famous and well-liked along black and latino guys. Would go out and go dancing with white women in LA. Police, sailors, soldiers run throughout the nightclubs and beat up and harrass Latino and Filipino guys.

	- Republican W. Wilkie running against FDR, clearly making race an issue -- Southern Democrats aren't going to make changes on race


Part II
- William Levitt
	- Expanse of suburban living and the single-family home, which radically changes American family life
	- Middle-class expectation of owning your own home -- central to middle-class American identity
	- New focus on getting Americans into single-family homes (mortgage industry changes allow for this)
	- Levittowns (PA, NY, NJ, MD, Puerto Rico) -- large massive suburbs, a new type of suburbs which hasn't existed before -- previous suburbs outside of large American towns had a lot of design features -- working class people in mind, sidewalks, trolley cars, etc. Levittowns essentially have no design -- efficiency, speed, selling towns -- not a healthful or satisfying middle-class life. Build and sell houses.
	- 1 new house every 15  minutes in PA
- Racial restrictions nad covenants
	- The way that people relate to each other begins to change
	- Levitts know that Americans who buy these houses don't want to livewith black epople, and so restirct black people 
	- Once these patterns start, hard to break

	- Pretty much the entire city all had racial covenants on pretty much every neighborhood
	- Inability for balck people to take part in the middle-class opportunity
- Seattle's red-lined map
	- Red lining -- a security map which idetnfieis neighborhoods by the likelihood that mortgage loans would be safely lent and repaid.
	- North of the Ship Canal is a very white area of Seattle
	- Redlined area is near downtown -- banks won't grant loans in the area
	- Process of redlining and racial covenance -- institutional/strucutral restrictions put on people of color
	- Other examples in insurance, real estate, banks, etc.
	- Net result is few Black people able to buy a home, and then unable to use that home as capital

	- Not allowed to live in other parts
	- Central District, Chinatown

- *To Secure These Rights*, Truman administration, 1948
	- Said -- there is a racial problem in America
	- Talked about how racism weakened the country because of the impact of the Communist party
	- Racism was an open wound which would bring down the country and which needed to be addressed
	- Structural and institutional racism in America
	- Different studies performed -- don't point the finger at anything, it is sort of actively happening, don't want to make any accusations. Reads sort of complacently

	- Attack on labor
	- Taft-Hartley Act (1947)  restricted the power of unions, strikes, and other labor activism by introducing the "right to work"
		- "right to work" -- if you are in a job and there is union activity, you do not have to join the union -- you can opt out of it.
		- A job which has half the people in and out of the union has little power
		- Unions are undercut in right to work states
		- Michigan became the first state to drop the right to work status and embraces unionism (recently)
- Anti-communist propaganda
	- Americans are bourght together under the sphere of a creeping socialism
- The turn to human rights
	- Eleanor Roosevelt, Universal Declaration of Human Rights 91948) -- equal in dignity, without distinction of any kind

- Civil Rights
	- New focus on Civil Rights which comes from some of the most prominent organizations: Thurgood Marshall, NAACP, Urban League, etc.
	- Governer Earl Warren of California -- during the war, happy with Japanese incarceration. After the war, changed his tune -- supported the Leage of United Latin American Citizens -- a convert to the ideal that Civil Rights problems were hurting our global reputation -- it's patriotic to stop being racist
	- 1950s -- NAACP works on specific issues; Marshall and Houstin on the Plessy v. Ferguson ruling of 'separate by equal'. 
	- What is significant about the 14th amendment -- establishment of citizenship and "equal under the law" -- getting to a revision of the interpretation of the 14th amendmetn (passed during Reconstruction which should change things -- but the courts define the 14th amendment narrower and narrower until you get separate but equal)
	- Reviewing different cases having to do with race -- qual protection under the law so narrow, so it is never really fully realized
	- NAACP wanting to revisit the 14th amendment, go after equal protection under the law clause
- 1954 Brown v. Board Topeka, Kansas ruling
	- HIghly calculated, not spontaneous
	- NAACP figuring out how to argue this the best, looking at different schools
	- Kansas is kind of a middle state
	- South -- it's easy to say "oh, it's the South" -- focus on Kansas might bring more national attention. 
	- By forcing Black students to walk much farther to go to a segregated school, it is uneven
	- Overturning of separate but equal in education
- Raising voices, taking notice
	- A number of events move things faster
	- Murder of Emmet Till -- significant because of the resonance it had within Black communities in the NOrth, getting out of the American South. 14 year old boy from Chicago who had gone South to visit family in Mississippi -- acted towards a white woman, and for doing so was tracked down and brutally tortured before he was murdered. Mother insisted on an open casket.
	- Chicago had a significant Black community

	- Historic importance of Christianity within the black communities of the South
	- King's speeches have great presence
	- 1956, SCLC emerges and becomes one of the galvanizing institutions for the Civil Rights movement -- maybe one to critque also, very top-heavy and focused on Christian values
	- SNCC is a very different institution -- don't really have leadership, almost intentionally, and in fact quite critical of the top-heavy nature of the SCLC
	- Civil Rights is often presented as monolithic but there are many different wings
	- Others are conencted with black internationalism: in contact with Kwame Nakruma (in contact with Ghana, independence in 1950s and becomes a stable democracy)
	- inspiration from decolonization
	- Bayard Rustin goes to India and inserts nonviolence into Civil Rights

	- State flags of Florida, Abama, etc. all have resonances with the Confederate Flag
	- Who are the real losers of the Civil War?
	- Race-mixing is communism
- Many obstacles to Civil Rights
	- 1957 -- token effort, US government passes the Civil Rights law which tries to put some enforcement into Civil Rights legislation; but without enforcement, there really isn't anything.
	- If it's not enfroced, what does it matter? It doesn't really matter.
	- There really is no enforcement here, and nor ights.
	- Little Rock, 1957 -- Eisenhower sends out the US military to enforce the integration law of the Supreme Court
- The Sit-Ins
	- Greensboro, NC
	- Student-led movements like the sit-ins beginning at the Whoolworths' where Black epople are not supposed to be, and sit at the counter nonviolently -- not there to respond to beatings and threats to be effective -- will be taken to jail and portrayed in the media as unruly ungovernable thugs who deserve what they get
	- Only by remaining non-violent even in the face of violence can they get their message across -- they need to be taught and schooled in this
	- Segregated beaches throughout the South -- "wade-ins" in Biloxi and Gulfport, Mississippi
	- A number of young Black people were killed as they attempted to do wade-ins
- Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC)
	- Ella Baker and the SNCC, 1960
	- Ella Baker - focuses on organizing young people and knew it would be young people who would be the vanguard of Civil Rights
	- Ella Baker was about getting away from focusing on leaders like MLK and putting the roles in the hands of the 'every-people' -- a decentralized movement, you can't blackmail or shame one leader because everyone is schooled int eh theory, tactics
	- Helps to form the Yougn Negroes Cooperative League which becomes SNCC
	- Robert Moses (passed away recently) -- a Northerner who came down to the South and did the same kind of organizing work among young people. 
- Freedom Rides (1961)

	- Get the federal government involved by going between states (across states, federal government gets involved -- creation of the martial service)
	- Taking busses from New York to Alabama  -- the response was intense and violent
	- John Lewis -- suffered horrible beating snad threats; busses being firebombed; to get in the national media, to show what is going on and to promote nonviolent tactics.
- To sum up
	- Talk about the importance of changing tactics, attitudes, strategies which come about because the Cold War context is dfiferent
	- Proliferation of young activists in particular -- changes to the Civil Rights movement.

## Lecture 4: Prosperity, Consumerism, and Environment
- Argument: The modernist view of a consumer-driven economy, which began around 1920, seemed to reach its zenith by about 1960 only to encounter new challenges in health, environment, discrimination, and the emergence of economic citizenship
- What starts off in the post-war period that America has reached this high standard of living begins to come undone -- emerging difficulties in public health, nuclear fear, ecology, and the environment
- How are consumer goods sold to the market? 
- Proliferation of consumer goods and a need to police and make consumer goods saf -- just companies trying to sell products.
- World War II produces many of the chemicals which will proliferate post-WWII. Companies make enormous chemicals for industrial applications and turn them into domestic products.
- Critique of consumer society
	- Henry Carter Adams, 1879 -- equitable division of property and produce, or despotism and decadence
- The great depression and the new deal (1930s)
	- How to solve the problems of the great depression? CHanging production to be more efficient -- producing more on less quantities of land
	- New Deal policies trying to produce more on less -- origin of agricultural subsidies, take land out of production so it can recover
	- Focusing science and chemical expertise onto farmland to produce more on less.
	- Decline of the small American farmer and the rise of larrge farm firms -- large agricultural companies -- not some nefarious plan but rather the Roosevelt administration is trying to find the most solid farmers with capital; consolidation of land across agriculture companies
	- New housing policies begun to spur more consumption
- Financing single-family home ownership
	- Changes in federal policies might be the most significant economic change to come out of WWII on housing
	- Federal Housing Act, 1934 and Home Owners Loan Corporation (1933)
	- Restructure the mortgage industry 
	- With increasing wages after the war, more and more people are moving into suburban spaces
- Consumers during WWII
	- During WWII, this is very intentional in ROosevelt's circle: already a focus on Americans as consumers, a kind of patriotic consumption going on.
	- Americans are rationing -- growing your own gardens (Victory garden) to not buy food which can go overseeds
	- Messages from the OWI (War Info) or OPA (Price Administration)
	- Consumers have a role to play as ptriots in rationing -- consuming in a particular way.
	- Women are a target as the primary consumers for households in the 1960s.
	- New step in market segmentation (division of population into groups and selling to them)
- Production during WWII
	- Production rates were incredibly high in WWII
	- Focus of the government is how to keep this high
	- OWI -- releasing state propaganda
	- State-capital cooperation needed to not fall into price issues, etc. -- OWI set prices so there wasn't crazy competition
	- War Labor Board -- made sure no stirkes during the war; CIO vowed no strikes during the war
	- Both 1942
	- Emergence of Keynesian economic theory -- the government needs to help out in the boom and bust cycles to not end up in the great depression
- From War to Peace
	- Post-war consensus around Keynesian economic theory
	- Economist Robert Nathan -- if mobilization for war, then why not for peacetime consumption?
	- Don't want to see a massive dip in consumption and production post-war
	- Beginning working on this post-war
- Post-war consensus on economics
	- In general, even conservatives in politics to some degree or another believed in Keynesian economic theory -- smoothed things out
	- Different emphases going on
	- 1945: proposed law that if people couldn't find jobs, the state had to create jobs for them (rjeected by conservatives)
	- 1946: employment act trying to keep employment at a high level
	- Purchasing power -- perhaps most visible phras in the post-war period: they want good jobs (great during the war -- union jobs), allows you to buy many of the consumer goods which are being produced
	- Mass consumption only possible with ongoing mass production
	- Looking for good-paying manufacturing jobs as the keystone of the economy
	- Consumer and military Keynesianism exist
		- Consumer Keynesianism: work with industry and labor unions to try and maintain ability to buy consumer goods
		- MIlitary Keynesianism: keeping Raytheon, Boeing, etc. operating at a high level -- especially aerospace industry getting enormous amount of money to continue doing what they're doing.
	- Even after the dip in the 1960s, the Vietnam War will keep consumer spending high for a while -- by early 70s the whole show is over and it begins to be laid bare there are problems with the American industrial sector
	- Mixture of public and private spending which keeps purchasing power very high
- Economic changes
	- The nuclear family -- images of the direct post-war period -- gathered around the TV in a single-family home in the new suburbs being designed all around America from coast-to-coast
	- Increasingly, idea of American freedom is being connected to economic citizenship -- to be an American citizen is to have a certain standard of living: at least a middle-class existence
	- Americans increasingly worry less about the political sphere and more about an economic sphere existence
	- By 1960, this swing has begun to happen
	- Poverty impacted greatly -- fallen 8% from 1950 to 1960
	- Emergence of credit by 1955 - a revolution in consumer purchasing
	- With the growth of credit, much more capacity for purchasing power -- just how much is being bought on credit?
	- Enjoy your consumer goods while you're paying them off! Increasing debt
- During this time, UC system is free or close to free if you're in-state -- monetization in the 70s
- Capitalist society -- if you don't have capital, you have your labor. 19th century -- huge land giveaways for many Europeans, or free education, etc.; ways to up the social status (although today neither of these are true -- what are the options today?)
- Origin point of ideological split in the middle 60s on Keynesianism -- Lyndon Johnson's huge spending budget, what to think about it?
- The reason for this primarily is that the people in moments of crisis could get on board with big government programs in this time of crisis; but it is these people who look at the same behavior and say, "it's a time of prosperity" -- why is the government messing around int eh free market economy still? Break from the neoliberal tradition and become neoconservatives
- HIgh point of American manufacturing is at 1955
- The Baby Boomers
	- "the luckiest generation" -- born during WWII with the fallout of the Great Depression
	- Generation which has good-paying jobs, availability of going to college
	- Baby boom generation which we compare other generations to -- up very high in 1950 - 55 -- families were very large, just more babies
	- When they get into college and become political active and consumers, these ptterns matter just simply because of numbers
	- As the baby boom generation ages, healthcare will become more important and this will effect the economy
	- Politically active generation
	- Part of this life is about 'materialism' -- living in new suburban spaces with more consumer products than before -- all these new things to put in people's homes
	- Some of these spaces are highly toxic spaces -- lead in a lot of the paint, asbestos, cosmetics, pesticides, insecticides, not necessarily safe and ti will take a while to figure it out.
	- People are also living very different kinds of lives in relaitonship to each other and the environment -- complete re-organization of social and environmental space. 
	- There are no sewer systems planned -- each house has its own sceptic system; can also be very dangerous; etc. When building suburbs, this is so 100s of people can live in the houses. Not desigend for traffic -- massive traffic problems.
	- Social isolation -- particular kind of space.
- In the New Deal period, you get a lot of ideology -- WPA, CC, etc. -- Roosevelt coming at you with ideology "promote confidence!" -- TVA, "electricity for all". Postwar period is different. Not a federal agency trying to provide you with a sense of values, bu tconsumerism -- buy stuff to make you happy, to reach a level of status, to make you feel good. Trying to find cultural value.
- Proliferation of plastics.
	- Plastics which had not really played much of a role in American life / economy before proliferate, largely remannts of war research
	- Bakelite -- an early plastic, a brittle and hard plastic
	- Changes becuase of WWII
	- Pre-war reputation for being cheap and inferior (to woods and metals)
	- Post-war spin on efforts by GE and other indutries to really promote plastics -- ligher weight, technologically innovative
	- Effort to naturalize plastics -- now that we've got it, we can do so much with it
	- Brownie Wise -- leaving advocate for Tupperware. Success story of post-war
	- Large-scale acceleration of packaging. Advertisements in the store. 
	- 1920s with mass production and consumption, you have department stores and grocery stores, in which the consumer gets their own products -- development of advertisements in these stores
	- A cereal box is a billboard -- now they are advertising at you
	- Massive amount of consumer products are in packages which are one-use, then throw out
	- Packaging becomes 1/3 of the waste stream and has increased by about 70% since 1960
- Landfills by 1960 and late 1970s -- landfills begin to proliferate over America and aren't regulated until they start causing problems. Issue -- landfills leak nasty stuff into the water and show up in water
	- Staten Island, NY -- largest landfill in the world by 1955
- Planned obsolescence
	- Market thinking and advertisement thinking throughout the economy
	- Finns on the backs of cars -- have no function, all about style. 
	- Car fashion -- designed to become obsolete
	- A way of manipulating consumer tastes by planning to keep things changing so consumers can keep up with what is the new thing now.
	- Creation of taste
	- Waste isbuilt into the system -- proliferation of landfills
	- Waste as a byproduct of the capitalist system -- increases standards of livign and produces commodities, sure; but much waste
	- What do people want to buy? Keeping up with the Joneses -- having good jobs which pay wages (purchasing power) which people can spend; we keep wages high so we can be consuming, which is a problematic relationship
- Highways
	- Cards are central to the economy and the suburban environment
	- Surbibanization is happening in many places in the world
	- Car culture is pretty unique to the US; the iea that your car becomes an expression about who you are as an individual; suburbs designed with cars and not busses in mind. Cars become central 
	- Henry Ford was in many ways an idealist; a particular vision of an ideal American society -- worker sshould be able to buy the products that they're building -- not egalitarian but a fair society in which people aren't slaving away; they can buy waht they produce. 
	- Fordlandia, Brazil
	- Cars have been central to the middle clas enviornment for a long timr -- definitely not an accident.=
- Oil -- no groweth wihthou it - 
- The government goes through a lot of funding to produce new things
- The new suburban house is now marketed heavily -- to rid it of the intruder
- Idea of being sold a chemically sterile, insect-free world. Being promoted as if the world is not right unless the insects are gone.
- Organophosphate deaths in the 1940s -- begin to see government regulation after deaths of factory and agricutlure workers are dying; indications that something is off.
- FIFRA (1947): starts as an attempt to protect consumers, turns out as a snake oil law -- no advertising if it doesn't work
- Murray Bookchin -- even in 1952 there is still revolutionary thinking: principle motive for chemicals and demands on frmland are imposed by the needs of profit and competition. 
- Viscose Rayon & CO2
	- Fllammable fabrics -- much more of this stuff than ever before
	- Flammables -- 6.4k people being killed a year by flammable fabrics and other consumer goods
	- Little kids' halloween costumes produced with Viscose Rayon
	- Clothing catches on fire so fast
	- Polyurethane foam -- put on furniture, referred to as 'solid gasoline'
	- Regulations on flammable fabrics -- Flammable Fabrics Act (1953)
	- Part of an American story: what is our fix? Never social or environmental confrontations to social or environmental problems: not by producing less flammable stuff, but rather alternative technologies -- tinkering with the technology so we cna continue to sell more
	- Chemical fire retardants
- Worker's health vs consumer satisfaction
	- Focused heavily on consumers -- the one group in Americna history which we have always struggled to come to terms with is industrial works -- this was never part of the American Dream; we don't celebrate the American industrial worker.
	- These sorts of topics are often a focus on the consumer
	- Carbon Disulfide -- as a consumer product, it's not very dangerous. But it is the workers who are producing this; inhaling it , touching it, etc.
	- Vinylchloride Monomer makes PVC pipes, which don't get regulation until the 1970s after OSHA is created
	- When they get regulated, it's for consumers -- not really for workers
- 1950s -- multiple-chemical sensitivity
	- Large gypsy moth problem in long island
	- Response -- DDT
	- Marjorie Spock -- lives with another woman who suffers from multiple-chemical sensitivity.
	- New York sprays DDT over their farm; Spock begins suing the state of New York because spraying their property. Begins as a property rights issue. What it becomes is more a sotry about public health. 
	- Attracts Rachel Carson
- Rachel Carson (1907 - 1964)
	- Biologist from Johns Hopkins
	- Is interested in these stories about nature and environmentalism
	- Silent Spring, 1962 -- investigations, meant to inspire women (targets of consumerism) and also pointing finger at the entymologists and other federal agents -- sterile, insect-free environments
	- Rising fears of nuclear way -- chemicals in consumers, health threats, etc.
	- Silent Spring makes a big splash; Kennedy reads it.
	- Criticizes post-war pesticides, USDA entomologists, the chemical industry, the intimacy between the state and the industry
	- Becomes influential in ecosystems ecology
	- Rachel Carson's book gets Kennedy thinking about the consumer bill of rights
- Reactions to Silent Spring
	- Smear campaign against Rachel Carson as a woman -- she can't be boht a scientist and a woman
	- Monsanto -- the desolate year, overrunning with insects if we don't use pesticides
	- Congress begins investigating
	- Kennedy creates an advisory committee
	- FIFRA act is improved a little bit to respond to these sorts of problems
- Kennedy's Consumer Bill of Rights in 1962 -- "consumers, by definition, includes us all"
- DDT Lawsuits: trucks sspraying DDT going down on people -- the kind of optimism and comformity that Ameircans have, we have faith that these sorts of things are safe or they can be saved -- not actuely toxic itself but not really questioned
	- No investigation about the interaction of multiple chemicals
- Environmental Defense Fund comes out of the DDT fight
- Nuclear science -- changing Americna society
- Strontium 90 -- what nuclear tests are doing to people. Strontium 90 is a byproduct of nuclear fission. Strontium 90 is like calcium; it attaches to bone, teeth, skin; we get strontium 90 in our bodies. 
- 1956 -- sound the alarm on this. Late 40s and early 50s, tos peak out against nuclear testing is a bit anti-American but mainstream politicians and people claiming that 10k people a day are dying from forms of radiation
- *On the Beach, 1957 + 1959. The nuclear cloud is coming for us
- Baby Teeth Experiment, 1959
	- Saint Louis -- look into the problem of strontium-90. Asking them to send children's baby teeth.
	- Collecting hundreds of thousands of baby teeth
	- Children born in St Louis in 1963 have 50x more Strontium 90 than in 1950
	- Results of nuclear testing are coming home
- By 1962, when the results of the baby teeth experiment and such are coming out, what before was a radical notion is now a thing which mainstream middle-American people are doing -- protesting against atmospheric testing
- 1963, Kennedy signs the partial nucelar test bans -- does not ban underground nuclear testing
- Middle-America's women are being targeted
- Ernest Dichter -- "One of the basic problems of prosperity, then, is to demonstrate that the hedonistic approach to life is a moral and not an immoral one." -- having a want and satisfying it is moral and not immoral. A change going on in the consumer economy. The single biggest cultural influence on Americna life is protestant Christian religion. 
- Greatest cultural influence today is consumerism -- even edating is consumer based (is this good enough?; shopping for a date)
- Values which used to be lodged into the consumer marketplace have moved into alternative places.
- For the advertisers and marketers, hedonism is necessary. Bush -- what can you do for your country? Go shopping.
- This idea that consumerism is good is not 'natural' -- it's historical, and emerges from a particular economy. Nothing is inevitable; decisions get made, and somehow we end up where we are. This swing in American life...
- 19th century, debt is something which Americans desperately try to stay away from (it makes you unfree); believed in moral values of hard work, etc. Dichter: turning to a hedonistic way of being, go satisfy all of your wants and desires.

## Lecture 5: Critique, Discontent, and Alternatives
The influences of African-American art-forms and the impulse to non-comformity helped to further fragment the 1960s as especially young people searched for alternate forms of expr

- God and reactions to Communism -- God-given vs natural-given, self-evident
- Turn towards unabashed consumerism challenges many previous morals
- We in many ways are more consumers than we are citizens -- who do very little to our political citizenship even though we consume daily.
- Conservatism, genuine -- technological conservatism, opposition to enamorment with consumerism
- Comformity of post-war enforced Ameircan values with patriotism, consumerism, etc.
- Critics of modern society -- Packard, the Hidden Persuaders / Risman, the Lonely Crowd -- cannot think for yourself.
- Critique of consumerism
- Galbraith -- focus on market satisfaction of produced desires
- Communism is set forth here -- enforcement of the mainstream
- Nuclear forces -- Oppenheimer expresses doubt on the hydrogen bomb exactly -- the philosophical metaphyisical conundrum, eventually accused of being a Communist
- The idea of "the Counterculture" -- the recent literature says that this is a horrible word to encompass much too many people. It is not a definition of a group. The 'counterculture' certainly directly challenges the mainstream, but there are many dimensions here. What about people out to have a good time, to smoke pot and listen to good music? This is not the same as movements with a political and philosophical edge. 
- Hippie movement lasts very short -- 18 months, consumerism culture gobblesd up hippieism.
- Expatriate writers
	- James Baldwin -- 1948, lived outside of the US. Felt could be more authentically himself outside of the US
	- Richard Wright, Arthur Himes -- novelists, critique from the outside of Ameircna society
- Allen Ginsburg, Howl. 1955. A centerpiece of the counterculture, articulating what that something which is wrong is. Becomes an intellectual keystone
- The Beats
	- Jack Keruoac -- being used and raw, On the Road -- non-comformity, no attachment, nomadic living
	- Keruac drank himself to death in 1969
	- Self indulgence and often a focus on male heroism -- felt that they had discovered an unfiltered freedom
	- Breaking boundaries in American life
	- Not everyone can go on the road -- women are often left behind. The solipsism of this poetry
	- William Bunourghe publishes a postmodern novel; nonlinear, meant to be opened anywhere. 
- 1950s to 1960s, Ameircnas are somewhat fine with drugs; many take drugs
- Jazz works alongside the beats; an admiration for Miles Davis, Bud Powell, etc. (beaten by police)
- Bebop -- a new form of jazz which is fast and loud, experimental, and exploratory
- Many of the Black jazz musicians faced greater freedom abroad than in America; Billy Holiday couldn't walk through the front door at the venue that she was playing at
- LSD captures the American imagination, particular in psychological circles -- advocated as a sort of miracle drug
