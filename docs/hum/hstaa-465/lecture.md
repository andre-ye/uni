## Lecture 1: The 1960s -- A Crisis of National Unity
Unfortunately my notes previously were lost because my computer lost battery and GitHub was stalling :(

- What is meant by consensus? Enough to provide definitiona nd form to the dominant culture
- Consensus over what? What was broken? What happens to the stories which hold the US together?
- American exceptionalism: the grand narrative of US history
- The acceptnace of New Deal liberalism
- WWII entirely changes the coordinates
- High unemployment in the US
- The US is built up by WWII -- the world's leading manufacturing econoy, an explosion of the middle class. WWII shapes everything. The monolith of WWII casts a shadow over everything we talk about. It is the children of WWII who are asked to go to Vietnam.
- Post WWI, we have a hightened sense of the US at its zenith.
- American exceptionalism: a grand narrative of US history after 1945. Defeat of totalitarianism, Nazi Germany, etc. Rebuilding of the ecnoy. A global reputation as a leader.
- Changing the global currency from the British pound to the US dollar. The UN is founded and located in NYC.
- Not simply -- the US as the greatest country in the world, but more importantly, the US and its people are not bound to historical trends and patterns which all other nations adn peoples are bound towards. The central claim of American exceptionalism. You can have coups and militant conflict, but we are these people  for whom the actions on the outside do not apply.
- Jan 6th -- this is not who we are, how could this happen here? We are this other group of people. This is now central to the story of American exceptionalism.
- Four narratives which underwrite post-1945 grad narratives of American exceptionalism: state and society, materialism, social liberation, and just war
- State and society
	- What is the relationship between civil society and the civilian?
	- Because of the origins in the US Constitution, our governmental system has design integrity against corrupt, incompetent individuals.
	- An incorruptability of the government
	- Assassinations, the Vietnam War, responses to civic protests, and **media coverage** destroyed the purity of the system. Thereafter Americans viewed the system as corrupted and elected officials as untrustworthy liars.
	- A nation so broken by the politics of the long 1960s.
	- Public trust in elected officials falls precipitously in the mid 60s.
	- Origin of the culture wars in Bill Clinton
	- high point in public trust after 9/11
	- All time low public trust currently.
	- Narrative of what happens between state and society? Our politics has been profoundly broken. 
- Materialism
	- Rivers catching on fire (Cuyahoga river fire, 1969)
	- Progressive nations, looking forward.
	- "the US has no history"
	- Fear of nuclear war, fallout, the world is falling -- the environment is collapsing. What is going to happen going forward?
	- The future is not necessarily better, and we see in this generation that the future indeed will pose large problems.
- Social liberation.
	- Civil rights -- we see the unacknowledged dominance of white men in society accepted
	- Generally normal, understood, and accepted.
	- "Good white people" (Malcolm X)
	- My life is my life, I'm not directly involved in oppression of black people: that's not my problem. An unchecked sense of superiority
	- Civil rights movements often conflict with each other: for instance there was a heavy dose of chauvanism running in the Black Panther Party.
- War.
	- Previous idea: America fights just wars and always wins.
	- Always in defense, never an aggressor
	- All problematic ideas. Why don't Ameircans know about the Phillipine war? Or much about the Korean war? Indigenous wars?
	- A source of shame emerged in the 1960s from Vietnam etc.: and a need to place **blame**. Who is to be blamed?
	- Americans aren't exceptional -- as demonstrated in Afghanistan.
	- The Civil War: different visions for the future; a radical abolitionist perspective, and also the ameleriorist vision which dominated and produced Jim Crow laws: America does not want to commit the Civil War to memory. Generations later, the Daughters of the Confederacy make the move to build the narrative of *lost cause*: the Confederates were still brave and noble men, just happening to be on the wrong side of the battle -- states rights, etc. 
	- What stories do we tell ourselves about what we are and where we came from?
	- The lost cause vision reinforces a white supremacist vision of America: rebirth of a nation.
	- Why were there so few executions after the Civil War? After the Dakota uprising, 38 Sioux leaders were hung. What kind of reconciliation did America settle with?
- Project idea: Understanding the relationship between analytic philosophers, educational institutions, and radical student movements in the 1960: precisely how analytic philosophy reconciled this with its political neutral and castrated philosophical position.

## Lecture 2: Last Shots, First Shots -- WWII and the New World Order
- Argument: WWII brought a sense that global order was needed to stave off another great conflagration in the future, but the emergence of the US and the Soviet Union as two great competing forces introduced a new destabilizing conflict. 
	- Brings about a desire for order, not only in the US and its allies but the USSR and similarly devastated countries -- a desire for order which conflicts between the US and the USSR, which attempt to impose a different form of order. This leads towards a contest for the mode of global order -- a new mode of destabilization. 
- Key terms -- don't think of them in an isolated way, understand how they fit together in a story.

### Part 1: Communism: A New Existential Threat
- Everything changes with WWII: a globally altering event.
- The US changes significantly: constantly imaging existential threats is something which starts in WWII -- a war against totalitarianism, will democracy survive? Confrontation with communism: the new existential threat
	- Nuclear war, threat to American system (capitalism, democracy, etc.)
- US war production
	- American working people help win the war: produced a lot of stuff used by Allies to win the war
	- American manufacturing sector grows significantly during WWII; US comes out not damaged but **built up**; Ford plants turned into making tanks. 
	- American manufacturing system changes the economic mode of the country.
	- Wages go up 68%, but cost of living comes up 28%; we now have an explosion of the American middle class. 
	- New Deal policies Roosevelt introduced help began a consolidation of power in the hands of large corporations, which cotinues throughout the war -- consolidation of farming, factory work, etc.
- Bretton Woods conference, 1944
	- World leaders get together and discuss econoics
	- Many trade barriers -- global economics stymied; greater free market system post-war.
	- More agreements for better trade exports, imports, etc.
	- Creationo f the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to help build up countreis from the war
	- Walter Lippman: 'father of Ameircan journalism' -- publishes *The New Republic*, 20th century as the American century
- Yalta Conference: Churchill, Roosevelt, Stalin; Potsdam: Atlay, Truman, Stalin
	- Begin talking about what to do with the rest of the world
	- Colonial possessions
	- Hemispheres of repirations -- USSR was heavily damaged, they want reparations. How to begin to recoop from the war.
	- What is the fate of Eastern Europe?
	- Truman becomes an interesting feature: weak foreign policy. Relies on many of his advisors, has many decisions to make. Deals with the situation developing in southeast Asia, etc. 
- US and Soviet troops meet at Elbe River in Germany (1945) -- both sides did try to make friends -- they had to. Tired from the war, no one wanted to keep on fighting. Everyone tried to make friends but theyw ere also fairly scared of each other at the same time.
- Stalin is an interestging figure: may be the worst mass murderer in all history. But his decisions really are quite moderate. He could have made more dictatorial positions but in fact what Stalin is doing in Eastern Europe after the war is trying to be conciliatory with the US and with Britain + the Allies. Although this does not last very long (only a few years) before large change. 
- Hiroshima and Nagasaki -- August 6 and 9, 1945. At least 145k civilians killed in 4 months
	- Signalling to the Russians that they were not going to get Japan
	- Usher in a new age of life: while it wants to control others' nuclear weapons, the US is the only country which has actuallye ver used them against civilian populations. 
	- Set off a new kind of international arms race: after some time many other countries have nuclear weapons
- WWII deaths -- Russia has had a major bloodletting in the Soviet Union; a large hand played in negotiations, they have suffered the most. Allies stopped in 1945 -- coudl have run further into Germany but hold back because Stalin wants soem of what's in Germany
	- 25m people in Soviet Union, China lost many civilians
	- United States: relatively small
- Russia as the 'sole great power on the Continent' -- area linking the black sea to the Mediterranean -- America wanted to make sure the Darnell strait was not something the Soviet could set up in, + shipping interests; also east and southeast asia become important areas of conflict
- US will back alkl of the colonial nations taking back their colonial possessions
	- Except Thailand, all of Asia was held by colonial powers
	- Occupation of Southern part of the korean peninsula and Japan
- China was in the middle of a large civil war
- Truman: really allowing the USSR to cast a big shadow. An unfortunate thing that there wasn't more clarity between America and the USSR
- US begcomes more interested in the Middle East: oil for security agreement with Saudi Arabia
	- Gets us interested in the middle east -- a linkage to oil.
	- FDR & King Abdulaziz on the USS Quincy, 1945
	- First modern, heavily mechanized armies. They eat a lot of oil: they need a large quantity of oil. The American economy now produces consumer goods with a large number of goods
- United Nations, 1945: New York, mission to collectively keep peace
	- Attempt to create a body which solves problems before they arise
	- To understand Germany with the eradication of Jews, there is an emerging term towards "human rights", which in fact had not been tossed around in international circles much before. This presents interesting problems for the US. What is the US record on human rights? The USSR gets great mileage by pointing at the American South and Black people. 
	- Truman: we are getting beat up at the UN over our civil rights record, we need to do something
	- Civil Rights: a push comes a lot from criticism during the Cold War who criticize us during the Cold War
- New Lexicon to the world: first, second, and third worlds -- a language which didn't exist before, but we now have this during the UN (1945)
	- Second order (Communism) is sort of done away now...
	- First and third world still returns
	- The language for this New Lexicon is a first world conception: first world people who thing about taxonomizing the world -- those who are like us and those who are not
	- This becomes a way to talk about people -- how do people talk about the world? WB, IMF -- targets, the 3rd world, to redirect consumer behavior towards American products
	- "development thesis" -- first world countries, wealthy countries of the world make large amounts of money from loans from the IMF and WB to go to the third world and build roads and dams which pay off well to the contractors but rarely solve third world problems
	- Not asking people in the third world what are you doing to solve your issues? Made money...
- Atomic energy commission (AEC) 
	- Looking at places to test more nuclear weapons. This nwill now be the critical dimension of the US military.
	- Turn to the South Pacific: some islands.
	- Choose the Marshall Islands: these are not empty, but like the removal of indigenous people, the US army goes in and moves them away so that they can test nuclear weapons after 1945
	- Large numbers of naval ships stay in the South Pacific -- chained animals to the deck to see what happens -- all theoretical physics.
	- If you read abuot the atmospheric tests, you will see that they are trying to understand the bombs -- the two bombs they tried in Japan were very different: culture of experimentation and testing, more efficient weapon building
	- These are fission bombs being tested; fusion happens in the Sun, but fission is going to be smaller. Hydrogen bombs are larger, use fusion
	- Operation Crossorads: Baker test at Bikini Atoll, Marshall Islands (1946)
	- Continues to fall into a hegemonic pattern of displacement
- Spread of Communism
	- A few places where there is no debate: Poland will be occupied by USSR, Stalin insisted on this
	- Bulgaria and Romania had worked with Germany but to be occupied byt he USSR
	- Czechoslovaki and Hungary had Free elections for a few years until in 1948 and 1949.
	- Communist nationalist resistance movements in other countries. 
	- What happens in Vietnam? Nationalists first, communists second
	- Cannot throw all countries (Albania, Yugoslavia, Korea, Vietnam, etc.) into just one communist movement -- 'international communism'
	- No distinction between nationalism, communism, socialism, etc. made by the US government
- George Kennan's "Long Telegram" (1946)
	- Kennan -- diplomat working in the Soviet Union
	- A telegram sent to the state government on what happens in the Soviet Union -- fears of capitalist encirclement leading to international manipulation, etc. Recommended the US identify the USSR as an enemy and begin strategic planning
	- Policy track: leads towards contingent steps in rising tensions, leads towards the Truman Doctrine, Marshall Plan, NSC-68: US policy of containment which gets the US into the Korean and Vietnam wars
- 1946, claim of post-WWII territory: an iron curtain has descended across the European continent. Dropping of an iron curtain behind which was only Soviet influence, not open to the free world.
	- 1946, Republicans gain both houses of congress, first since 1932.
	- Truman looked in trouble, but later wrote that this in fact freed him up. He felt freer, he could take bold action which hew anted to take anyway. Bold action on Civil Rights and the Cold War
- The Truman Doctrine (1947)
	- Lending of large amounts of money to places in the world such that they didn't fall under the influence of the Soviet Union
	- Military aid given to Turkey and Greece
	- Truman -- wanted to see Germany unified, currently divided across US, Britain, France, USSR
	- Marshall Plan: $13 billion given to European nations, again to resist Communist influence, staying within American realm
	- Policy of containment: putting in place new forms of aid and weaponry to push back the Soviets, to make sure Communism didn't spread
	- Belief of two worlds emerging -- one free, and one Moscovian
- McCarthyism and the Red Square -- late 1940s to mid 1950s
	- Senator Joseph McCarthy from Wisconsin made himself very well known by making accusations and suggestions that there were many communist subversives in the US political structure
	- Threw out this idea and it landed very well: people picked up on it and McCarthy really went after it -- had lists of who was a Communist
	- Freaked out the whole country about Comunists in our mist
	- Second Red Scare (after 1920s), became really dangerous to be accused of being a communist -- blacklisted from services, lose your job... agencies began working on it, FBI and CIA expanded massively (CIA relatively new) and begins to look into American behaviors, NSA emerges, AEC does secret tests on people in state-run facilities. Orphans with mental disabilities -- feeding radioactive food, etc. Peeking into private lives. This is where we get the great fear-mongering around homosexuality, which hadn't really been put down before.
	- Banning of homosexuals from military service (1949) -- homosexuality would be so shameful that it would make someone easy to be blackmailed
	- Not easy to be critical of nuclear testing, could get you accused of being a communist
	- mid 50s, people stopped taking McCarthy so serious, drunk himself to death
	- Fear of communism begins to erode American values -- people begin to register fear about what it means: what if Americans are spying on each other and giving away names, what does that mean for American values? What does our country stand for? Look at what Communism is doing for us as a nation?
- Communist China
	- Communists in China win the Civil War in 1949, nationalists move to Taiwan and mainland China is taken over under Mao Zedong
	- US had never possessed China but registered this as the loss of China: the divide of the world into 2, a zero-sum game: if we don't possess it, we've lost it
	- Fever pitch of American fears of communism -- communism would not march around the world!
	- Soviet Union tested their first nuclear device: now not the only ones holding nuclear weapons
	- NATO (1949) -- put Europe under the nuclear umbrella, to be guarded by American forces.
- NSC-68 and the policy of containment (1950)
	- NSC-68: US policy statement that the Cold War was an epic struggle between freedom and the slavery and grim oligarchy of communism
	- Foreign policy as an epic struggle between these two forces
	- USSR animtated by a fanatic faith to take over the world, aniothetically
	- Need to contain the USSR and not let it spread any further.
	- This leads us to containment, which leads the US to become mired in these wars
	- Means: US needs more money for infrastructure, tanks, etc. -- Americna taxpayers have a hefty bill to pay, people begin to worry about the taxes needed -- what does this mean to the US?; and new concrete policy direction
- By 1950, US is thinking about aid
	- Creation of Israel, military aid for Iran and Saudi Arabia, aid to all SE Asia nations, defense of Taiwan, etc. -- all a fear of Communism
	- Worried about nuclear disaster -- get under the desk and cover up, practicing for a nuclear war. 
	- Paradox of preparing to conront a totalitarian enemy -- what is the existential threat of communism doing to the country?
	- Might the US become a **garrison state**? -- a state which raises taxes, has a global military presence, peers into American lives, reorient what we mean by freedom
- A free nation as a world power: battling foreign influence without ruining the US -- ho to become a garrison state. 
- At this point where the US commits to global military dominance, begins with this sort of Communist scare
	- Eisenhower: beware the military industrial complex
- Hydrogen bomb, 1952. New interest in developing fusion bombs. First tested in 1952, another level of the Cold War and the arms race: begins metaphysical conversations about what is going on, what will happen int he world, etc. 10,400 vs 15 (atomic) kt of TNT.
	- What is man capable of? Doing what the sun has done?
	- The Atomic Cafe
	- People are very much kept in the dark -- atomic malaise which sets in
	- Something significant about the *hydrogen* in hydrogen bomb -- the smallest, most innocuous element
	- Oppenheimer, in charge of the WWII bombs, changes his tune, is later against hydrogen bombs. Should we build the hydrogen bomb? Create the fission explosino to make the fusion explosion. Oppenheimer: don't do it, we shouldn't open that door, leads you down this metaphysical existential pathway.
	- Caastle Bravo Test, Marshall Islands, 1954 -- exceeded the projected power by 2505, 1000x larger than the Hiroshima bomb. They don't really know what they are doing
- Fallout
	- Even though staked out an area to protect people, explosion was bigger and cut some people, including Japanese Fisherman "The Lucky Dragon", died of radioactive poisoning
	- Radioactive materials showed up in America's ports: radioactive tea, radioactive tuna: unleashing a massive public health problem

### Part 2: Battlefields of the Cold War
- Decolonization and the third world
- Major changes in WWII -- beginning of decolonization. The US had in 46 given Philippine Independence. US pressured GB to give up its colonies as well. Belief in the self determination of nations
- Philippines: Spanish then American then Japanese then American (1946)
- British Empire at its height held 1/4 of the globe
- India and Gandhi
	- Salt March to protest British salt monopoly 
	- Indian and Pakistani independence in 1947
	- Realization by colonized people that thei rresources are being extracted unjustly
	- The attempt to nationalize resources
	- Gandhi was interested in nonviolent tactics and will influence many leaders in the Civil Rights movement.
	- Byard Ruston -- not written in the history books because he was gay -- education of non-violent tactics into American civil rights.
- Korea: test of US containment policy
	- 1948 - 1950: became the focus point for an early cold war
	- Strategically unimportant; Americans know almost nothing about it and don't want to be involved in it. But needs to be a place which the US must stand up in. 
	- Korean War, 1950 - 1953: Kim Il Sung (communist-nationalist) and Syngman Rhee (anti-communist, authoritarian) -- Rhee not a great ally but this is what we got with
- Korean War: 1950, Communists attacked in the South and almost push UN forces out of the peninsula; then American forces come in and push Communist forces back into the South and almost go to the river; then 1951 Chinese come across the border and push the Americans back to the current obrder between north and south Korea. Fight over the DMZ.
- French in indochina -- want to come back. There is an anti-colonial revolution in Indochina. French in Indochina since 1858. Vietnamese communist resistance movement getting rid of the japanese, then the French -- not saviors, and do not want to open up to French colonization. US supported France even though it was counter to the self-determination beliefs
	- National Liberation Front, Viet Minh -- getting better at how to fight the French
	- Kennedy -- stopping wars of 'national liberation'
	- French and anti-communists in the South Vietnam: French-speaking Buddhists, didn't really respect their own population -- **not uncommon** in post-colonial societies.
	- The colonized leaders -- colonizers leave but new people who take over are not necessarily great
- French defeat by the Viet Minh at Dien Bien Phu, Indochina -- beat the French, battle which goes on (French set them up in a poor spot), Viet Minh forces came from all over until the French gave up
- What will the US do now? The French failure...
- Iran (1953)
	- Battlefield of the Cold War
	- Place with lots of resources and oil
	- Anglo-Iranian oil company (becomes BP) -- interested in connections with Iranian oilfields
	- Occupation of Iran? Soviet Union kept out of Iran by US
	- Iranians accept Mohammed Mossadegh ran on the premise of nationalizing Iranian oil -- giving Iranian oil to Iranians vs foreign policies.
	- Nationalization fo resources smacks like communism to American ears: British and American secret organizations installed the Shah Mohammed Pahlavi (old religious leader) as the leader -- got rid of Mossadegh, now had a Western-friendly nation to develop oil
- Suez Crisis (1956)
	- Middle East continued to be important
	- Nationalization of resource -- the Suez Canal in Egypt, Nasser (Egyption president) wanted to nationalize it for Egyptions
	- Israelis, British, and French invaded Egypt without informing the US
	- US settled the Suez crisis -- interest in the Suez Canal 
	- Eisenhower later sending 5000 Marines to Lebanon
- Guatemala (1954)
	- US interested in this palce where we have countries largely owned by the United Fruit Company (American fruit company which did well in latin America) -- held large amounts of land in almsot all land in central America.
	- A blight had hit the soil in the banana plantations and wiped out the bananas.
	- Land not being grown because of the soil blright, not being used -- poor Guatemalans are getting pissed.
	- Arbenz runs on land redistribution -- sounds pretty communist to Americans.
	- Jacobo Arbenz Guzman elected in 1951, nationalist, noncommunist
	- Installs a right-wing authoritarian dictator Carlos Castillos Armas who is friendly to the United States
- Latin American communists
	- Che Guavara -- living in Guatemala at the time. Ernesto "Che" Guevara
	- An important part of how communism gets to Cuba
	- Guevara & Castro
	- Go to a province in Cuba which had previously been dominated and find lots of angry Cuban peasants who don't like ending of communal land fields, etc. -- turning into exports, forced globalization
	- By 1959, US Americans controlled 75% of Cuba's arable land, ended community alndholdings
	- Cuba not held as a colony -- but still, Cuba could not trade with anyone other than the US -- Cuba became a sugar plantation.
	- Milton Hershey -- one of the pioneers of vertical integration -- own all the mechanisms of the production process, and therefore you ca make enormous profits. Cuba did great for Herhsey's profits
	- 1959, Cuban Revolution -- communists win in Cuba. Defeat the miitary forces, Baptiste (old President) flees to the US, Cuban exiles end up in Miami (people who later come back in Bay of Pigs invasion)
	- US: now we have a communist nation in the Western hemisphere, not too far from the United Sttes.
	- CIA begin to think of how to get rid of the communist government
- Space race and arms race
	- How to build on not only more nuclear weapons but other elements of the nuclear triad: land-based missiles, bombers, submarines
	- Burgenoning space race, 1957 -- Soviets succeeded in getting Sputnik going around -- about the size of a large basketball -- Soviet-made object was circling over their heads
	- Soviets leading the world in rocketry -- what is the SOviets develop better rockets?
	- Bomber gap, missile gap -- possible development of a garrison state
	- Stalin -- anyone who spent time around the West were dangerous -- former Soviet soldiers, straight to the Gulag
- Mutually assured destruction
	- Secretary of State Dulles, massive retaliation
	- Allan Dulles: head of the CIA, Dulles brothers cast a large shadow
		- Involved in many coups
	- American strategy: massive retaliation and mutually assured destruction
	- US would have such a large stockpile that they could deliver a massive retaliation if the Soviets attacked anywhere in the world.
	- Deterrence theory
	- As people began to point out, what does MAD really mean? We will blow each other up, what sense does this make? A free society which will build large stockpiles and take large taxes, but to use it is to lose -- they will never be used. Their function is to sit there and wait; they serve as a deterrent. Nuclear madness -- no one wants to fire one, and yet the investment into fiction -- negative force.
- Capitalism breeds mediocrity -- they have to be largely palatable.
	- Our bananas are unflavorable lol

## Lecture 3: The Ongoing Struggle for Civil Rights
- Argument: WWII changed the conversation over civil rights by placing the US in a struggle for human freedom. The war's outcome and the meanings of the Cold War empowered new leaders, spurred new efforts, led to new tactics that advanced civil rights in America

Part I
- What new role will the US play in race relations?
- The great depression and the new deal (1930s)
	- Paul Robeson -- someone who has a prevoius relationship to the Soviet Union -- is blacklisted from Hollywood, cannot perform because he was seent o have Communist sympathies. 
	- Changes from the 1930s to the 1950s: in the 1930s, the New Deal was an attempt to alleviate the problems of the stock market crash and the crisis of capitalism in the Great Depression -- New Deal policies were heavily discriminatory
		- It's easy to think that the federal government wrote discriminatory policies
		- Rarely deos the federal government at this time strictly discriminate
		- Instead, the way to sell these to Americans is that the federal policy money is locally administered -- local people can put their own spin on the policy -- hire people where you want or need them
		- The New Deal by this fashion ends up being discriminatory -- excludes Black people. 
	- Popular front: coalition of working class people who are trying to fix problems in America, and to bring in influences from the far left. What emerges is a coalition of laborers -- a time to help out the little guy, the working man, the popular front. Turns into an acceptance of ethnic groups which previously haven't been accepted (Italians, Jews, Catholics). 
	- Communist party plays an important rule here because it's the only group in America doing anything about race -- specifically challenges the US on issueus of race.
	- Communist party says that race and gender are tools of capitalism. The CP is trying to take actions on race
	- Highly publicized cases
		- Scottsboro case 1931 -- 9 young black men are accused of rape by two white women. Both of the women will recant it. But it has implications for the Supreme Case
		- Powell v Alabama (1932) -- the young men never got any kind of good representation
		- Norris v Alabama (1935) -- systemic exclusion of Black people from juries
		- Scottsboro case is one of the most important court cases which opens peoples' eyes to systemic problems in the criminal justice system
	- CIO -- labor union which comes in the model of the old IWW. IWW was important because they would organize everyone. Many other labor unions were historically very discriminatory (e.g. AFL). The CIO with the CP begin to challenge race lines, bring in more black people inot labor unions
	- Ongoing segregation in the South, lynching had not lessenned. 
- 1941 lend-lease act
	- WW2 is important for what happens to Civil Rights because the US begins to produce a lot of stuff
	- Many jobs are union jobs with good pay
	- America begins to send stuff to all manner of items
	- The US already produces a lot of stuff
- "Arsenal of democracy": US War Production 1940 - 45
	- The US creates huge amounts of stuff to win the war
	- Domestic stuff: cigarette manufacturers got declared as a necessary sector of the economy 
	- Unified effort in WW2 to win -- a lot of work, jobs, and production
- FDR and selling the war
	- Four Freedoms speech (1941) 
	- The US were before very isolationist -- American First committee who did not want to go to war, America should stay out of Europe
	- FDR working on how to sell the ar to the United States
	- Four Freedoms speech visualized by Norman Rockwell
	- Freedom of speech, worship, from fear, from want.
	- Need for national stories: this is a national story, ths is who we are
	- Atlantic Charter: belief in making a pact with European Allies will help bring a world-safer democracy
- A Philip Randolph
	- Black people still very much held apart from this national unity
	- As 'interior others' -- still being othered, interior ro the nation (provide a lot of labor) but still held as seocnd-class citizens
	- 1941, Roosevelt is trying to get Americans to see they are on the same page
	- Black people know they are not unified
	- A Philip Randolph, head of union of black pullman car porters -- threatened a massive Civil Rights demonstration in DC
	- Let Roosevelt knew in this moment of attempted unity that black workers would hold a massive demonstration to show just how ununited the country was -- the last thing FDR wanted
	- From A Philip Randolph's pressure, Roosevelt had to make important policy concessions
	- Creationo f the Fair Employment Practices Commission (1941 - 1946): investigate labor conditions in war industries
	- There remained ways to discriminate: unions, pay, conditions, etc. -- Black people not allowed to be in 'skilled' positions -- last hired, first fired
	- 1942, Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) -- important Black Civil Rights organization which will continue to play an important role throughout
	- Urban league in 1909, 1910 -- growing rights organizations
- Double V for Victory -- Victory at home over racism and Victory abroad over totalitarianism
- Second Great Migration -- many white AMeicans begin to see it differently after many black people move out of the South in WW2 to take new jobs in western and northern manufacturing jobs. (First Great Migration happens in WWI). 
	- Southernization of American culture -- take and spread culture
- Blacks during wartime
	- Northerns and Westererners don't want then there either -- a problem with the entire country

	- New situation that white Americans are encountering
- 1943, racial unrest in 34 CS cities
	- Race riots between white and black
	- Affter the frist great migration, we got the rise of a new KKK (first comes after Civil Rights to fight against northerners coming into the South, but became defunt with new segregation laws -- no need for a campaign of terror). Not a Southern entity at all -- a KKK of the north and the west (biggest chapters in Oregon, Indiana, Iowa, etc.). Not entirely new but now on a  new scale.
	- A new focus: united
- Wartime industrial jobs
	- Changes going on in the workplace

- Blacks and military service
	- Until 1948, segregated units
	- Most Black people serve in segregated units with specific types of jobs -- truck drivers, barbers, cooks
	- Limits to the GI Bill -- the GI BIll is a major change to American life because of WW2 and FDR type policies
	- The GI Bill
	- Homeowner's loan corporation -- begins to remake the industry
	- Federal government is involved in giving out home loans, and changes the industry because it forces the private mortgage industry to come down on elements of the mortgage. The American middle class expands enormously and more people can buy homes.
	- In fact quite good for capitalism, because no the consumer class grows
	- part of a change over to a consumer economy
	- GI Bill -- millions of Americans can get zero percent down loan with zero percent interest to build a farm, go to college, buy a house, etc. -- many could not do so before, now can
	- Same kinds of racial restrictions are in place -- local restriction
- The Bracero Program (1942 - 1964)

	- 22 million people or so moving across the border to work -- generation of this sort of movement even helps explain today's population
	- Employers get used to hiring certain kinds of workers and laborers
- Zoot Suit Riots, LA (1943)
	- Zoot suit -- long jacket flamboyant suit, sometimes with flashy colors -- famous and well-liked along black and latino guys. Would go out and go dancing with white women in LA. Police, sailors, soldiers run throughout the nightclubs and beat up and harrass Latino and Filipino guys.

	- Republican W. Wilkie running against FDR, clearly making race an issue -- Southern Democrats aren't going to make changes on race


Part II
- William Levitt
	- Expanse of suburban living and the single-family home, which radically changes American family life
	- Middle-class expectation of owning your own home -- central to middle-class American identity
	- New focus on getting Americans into single-family homes (mortgage industry changes allow for this)
	- Levittowns (PA, NY, NJ, MD, Puerto Rico) -- large massive suburbs, a new type of suburbs which hasn't existed before -- previous suburbs outside of large American towns had a lot of design features -- working class people in mind, sidewalks, trolley cars, etc. Levittowns essentially have no design -- efficiency, speed, selling towns -- not a healthful or satisfying middle-class life. Build and sell houses.
	- 1 new house every 15  minutes in PA
- Racial restrictions nad covenants
	- The way that people relate to each other begins to change
	- Levitts know that Americans who buy these houses don't want to livewith black epople, and so restirct black people 
	- Once these patterns start, hard to break

	- Pretty much the entire city all had racial covenants on pretty much every neighborhood
	- Inability for balck people to take part in the middle-class opportunity
- Seattle's red-lined map
	- Red lining -- a security map which idetnfieis neighborhoods by the likelihood that mortgage loans would be safely lent and repaid.
	- North of the Ship Canal is a very white area of Seattle
	- Redlined area is near downtown -- banks won't grant loans in the area
	- Process of redlining and racial covenance -- institutional/strucutral restrictions put on people of color
	- Other examples in insurance, real estate, banks, etc.
	- Net result is few Black people able to buy a home, and then unable to use that home as capital

	- Not allowed to live in other parts
	- Central District, Chinatown

- *To Secure These Rights*, Truman administration, 1948
	- Said -- there is a racial problem in America
	- Talked about how racism weakened the country because of the impact of the Communist party
	- Racism was an open wound which would bring down the country and which needed to be addressed
	- Structural and institutional racism in America
	- Different studies performed -- don't point the finger at anything, it is sort of actively happening, don't want to make any accusations. Reads sort of complacently

	- Attack on labor
	- Taft-Hartley Act (1947)  restricted the power of unions, strikes, and other labor activism by introducing the "right to work"
		- "right to work" -- if you are in a job and there is union activity, you do not have to join the union -- you can opt out of it.
		- A job which has half the people in and out of the union has little power
		- Unions are undercut in right to work states
		- Michigan became the first state to drop the right to work status and embraces unionism (recently)
- Anti-communist propaganda
	- Americans are bourght together under the sphere of a creeping socialism
- The turn to human rights
	- Eleanor Roosevelt, Universal Declaration of Human Rights 91948) -- equal in dignity, without distinction of any kind

- Civil Rights
	- New focus on Civil Rights which comes from some of the most prominent organizations: Thurgood Marshall, NAACP, Urban League, etc.
	- Governer Earl Warren of California -- during the war, happy with Japanese incarceration. After the war, changed his tune -- supported the Leage of United Latin American Citizens -- a convert to the ideal that Civil Rights problems were hurting our global reputation -- it's patriotic to stop being racist
	- 1950s -- NAACP works on specific issues; Marshall and Houstin on the Plessy v. Ferguson ruling of 'separate by equal'. 
	- What is significant about the 14th amendment -- establishment of citizenship and "equal under the law" -- getting to a revision of the interpretation of the 14th amendmetn (passed during Reconstruction which should change things -- but the courts define the 14th amendment narrower and narrower until you get separate but equal)
	- Reviewing different cases having to do with race -- qual protection under the law so narrow, so it is never really fully realized
	- NAACP wanting to revisit the 14th amendment, go after equal protection under the law clause
- 1954 Brown v. Board Topeka, Kansas ruling
	- HIghly calculated, not spontaneous
	- NAACP figuring out how to argue this the best, looking at different schools
	- Kansas is kind of a middle state
	- South -- it's easy to say "oh, it's the South" -- focus on Kansas might bring more national attention. 
	- By forcing Black students to walk much farther to go to a segregated school, it is uneven
	- Overturning of separate but equal in education
- Raising voices, taking notice
	- A number of events move things faster
	- Murder of Emmet Till -- significant because of the resonance it had within Black communities in the NOrth, getting out of the American South. 14 year old boy from Chicago who had gone South to visit family in Mississippi -- acted towards a white woman, and for doing so was tracked down and brutally tortured before he was murdered. Mother insisted on an open casket.
	- Chicago had a significant Black community

	- Historic importance of Christianity within the black communities of the South
	- King's speeches have great presence
	- 1956, SCLC emerges and becomes one of the galvanizing institutions for the Civil Rights movement -- maybe one to critque also, very top-heavy and focused on Christian values
	- SNCC is a very different institution -- don't really have leadership, almost intentionally, and in fact quite critical of the top-heavy nature of the SCLC
	- Civil Rights is often presented as monolithic but there are many different wings
	- Others are conencted with black internationalism: in contact with Kwame Nakruma (in contact with Ghana, independence in 1950s and becomes a stable democracy)
	- inspiration from decolonization
	- Bayard Rustin goes to India and inserts nonviolence into Civil Rights

	- State flags of Florida, Abama, etc. all have resonances with the Confederate Flag
	- Who are the real losers of the Civil War?
	- Race-mixing is communism
- Many obstacles to Civil Rights
	- 1957 -- token effort, US government passes the Civil Rights law which tries to put some enforcement into Civil Rights legislation; but without enforcement, there really isn't anything.
	- If it's not enfroced, what does it matter? It doesn't really matter.
	- There really is no enforcement here, and nor ights.
	- Little Rock, 1957 -- Eisenhower sends out the US military to enforce the integration law of the Supreme Court
- The Sit-Ins
	- Greensboro, NC
	- Student-led movements like the sit-ins beginning at the Whoolworths' where Black epople are not supposed to be, and sit at the counter nonviolently -- not there to respond to beatings and threats to be effective -- will be taken to jail and portrayed in the media as unruly ungovernable thugs who deserve what they get
	- Only by remaining non-violent even in the face of violence can they get their message across -- they need to be taught and schooled in this
	- Segregated beaches throughout the South -- "wade-ins" in Biloxi and Gulfport, Mississippi
	- A number of young Black people were killed as they attempted to do wade-ins
- Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC)
	- Ella Baker and the SNCC, 1960
	- Ella Baker - focuses on organizing young people and knew it would be young people who would be the vanguard of Civil Rights
	- Ella Baker was about getting away from focusing on leaders like MLK and putting the roles in the hands of the 'every-people' -- a decentralized movement, you can't blackmail or shame one leader because everyone is schooled int eh theory, tactics
	- Helps to form the Yougn Negroes Cooperative League which becomes SNCC
	- Robert Moses (passed away recently) -- a Northerner who came down to the South and did the same kind of organizing work among young people. 
- Freedom Rides (1961)

	- Get the federal government involved by going between states (across states, federal government gets involved -- creation of the martial service)
	- Taking busses from New York to Alabama  -- the response was intense and violent
	- John Lewis -- suffered horrible beating snad threats; busses being firebombed; to get in the national media, to show what is going on and to promote nonviolent tactics.
- To sum up
	- Talk about the importance of changing tactics, attitudes, strategies which come about because the Cold War context is dfiferent
	- Proliferation of young activists in particular -- changes to the Civil Rights movement.

## Lecture 4: Prosperity, Consumerism, and Environment
- Argument: The modernist view of a consumer-driven economy, which began around 1920, seemed to reach its zenith by about 1960 only to encounter new challenges in health, environment, discrimination, and the emergence of economic citizenship
- What starts off in the post-war period that America has reached this high standard of living begins to come undone -- emerging difficulties in public health, nuclear fear, ecology, and the environment
- How are consumer goods sold to the market? 
- Proliferation of consumer goods and a need to police and make consumer goods saf -- just companies trying to sell products.
- World War II produces many of the chemicals which will proliferate post-WWII. Companies make enormous chemicals for industrial applications and turn them into domestic products.
- Critique of consumer society
	- Henry Carter Adams, 1879 -- equitable division of property and produce, or despotism and decadence
- The great depression and the new deal (1930s)
	- How to solve the problems of the great depression? CHanging production to be more efficient -- producing more on less quantities of land
	- New Deal policies trying to produce more on less -- origin of agricultural subsidies, take land out of production so it can recover
	- Focusing science and chemical expertise onto farmland to produce more on less.
	- Decline of the small American farmer and the rise of larrge farm firms -- large agricultural companies -- not some nefarious plan but rather the Roosevelt administration is trying to find the most solid farmers with capital; consolidation of land across agriculture companies
	- New housing policies begun to spur more consumption
- Financing single-family home ownership
	- Changes in federal policies might be the most significant economic change to come out of WWII on housing
	- Federal Housing Act, 1934 and Home Owners Loan Corporation (1933)
	- Restructure the mortgage industry 
	- With increasing wages after the war, more and more people are moving into suburban spaces
- Consumers during WWII
	- During WWII, this is very intentional in ROosevelt's circle: already a focus on Americans as consumers, a kind of patriotic consumption going on.
	- Americans are rationing -- growing your own gardens (Victory garden) to not buy food which can go overseeds
	- Messages from the OWI (War Info) or OPA (Price Administration)
	- Consumers have a role to play as ptriots in rationing -- consuming in a particular way.
	- Women are a target as the primary consumers for households in the 1960s.
	- New step in market segmentation (division of population into groups and selling to them)
- Production during WWII
	- Production rates were incredibly high in WWII
	- Focus of the government is how to keep this high
	- OWI -- releasing state propaganda
	- State-capital cooperation needed to not fall into price issues, etc. -- OWI set prices so there wasn't crazy competition
	- War Labor Board -- made sure no stirkes during the war; CIO vowed no strikes during the war
	- Both 1942
	- Emergence of Keynesian economic theory -- the government needs to help out in the boom and bust cycles to not end up in the great depression
- From War to Peace
	- Post-war consensus around Keynesian economic theory
	- Economist Robert Nathan -- if mobilization for war, then why not for peacetime consumption?
	- Don't want to see a massive dip in consumption and production post-war
	- Beginning working on this post-war
- Post-war consensus on economics
	- In general, even conservatives in politics to some degree or another believed in Keynesian economic theory -- smoothed things out
	- Different emphases going on
	- 1945: proposed law that if people couldn't find jobs, the state had to create jobs for them (rjeected by conservatives)
	- 1946: employment act trying to keep employment at a high level
	- Purchasing power -- perhaps most visible phras in the post-war period: they want good jobs (great during the war -- union jobs), allows you to buy many of the consumer goods which are being produced
	- Mass consumption only possible with ongoing mass production
	- Looking for good-paying manufacturing jobs as the keystone of the economy
	- Consumer and military Keynesianism exist
		- Consumer Keynesianism: work with industry and labor unions to try and maintain ability to buy consumer goods
		- MIlitary Keynesianism: keeping Raytheon, Boeing, etc. operating at a high level -- especially aerospace industry getting enormous amount of money to continue doing what they're doing.
	- Even after the dip in the 1960s, the Vietnam War will keep consumer spending high for a while -- by early 70s the whole show is over and it begins to be laid bare there are problems with the American industrial sector
	- Mixture of public and private spending which keeps purchasing power very high
- Economic changes
	- The nuclear family -- images of the direct post-war period -- gathered around the TV in a single-family home in the new suburbs being designed all around America from coast-to-coast
	- Increasingly, idea of American freedom is being connected to economic citizenship -- to be an American citizen is to have a certain standard of living: at least a middle-class existence
	- Americans increasingly worry less about the political sphere and more about an economic sphere existence
	- By 1960, this swing has begun to happen
	- Poverty impacted greatly -- fallen 8% from 1950 to 1960
	- Emergence of credit by 1955 - a revolution in consumer purchasing
	- With the growth of credit, much more capacity for purchasing power -- just how much is being bought on credit?
	- Enjoy your consumer goods while you're paying them off! Increasing debt
- During this time, UC system is free or close to free if you're in-state -- monetization in the 70s
- Capitalist society -- if you don't have capital, you have your labor. 19th century -- huge land giveaways for many Europeans, or free education, etc.; ways to up the social status (although today neither of these are true -- what are the options today?)
- Origin point of ideological split in the middle 60s on Keynesianism -- Lyndon Johnson's huge spending budget, what to think about it?
- The reason for this primarily is that the people in moments of crisis could get on board with big government programs in this time of crisis; but it is these people who look at the same behavior and say, "it's a time of prosperity" -- why is the government messing around int eh free market economy still? Break from the neoliberal tradition and become neoconservatives
- HIgh point of American manufacturing is at 1955
- The Baby Boomers
	- "the luckiest generation" -- born during WWII with the fallout of the Great Depression
	- Generation which has good-paying jobs, availability of going to college
	- Baby boom generation which we compare other generations to -- up very high in 1950 - 55 -- families were very large, just more babies
	- When they get into college and become political active and consumers, these ptterns matter just simply because of numbers
	- As the baby boom generation ages, healthcare will become more important and this will effect the economy
	- Politically active generation
	- Part of this life is about 'materialism' -- living in new suburban spaces with more consumer products than before -- all these new things to put in people's homes
	- Some of these spaces are highly toxic spaces -- lead in a lot of the paint, asbestos, cosmetics, pesticides, insecticides, not necessarily safe and ti will take a while to figure it out.
	- People are also living very different kinds of lives in relaitonship to each other and the environment -- complete re-organization of social and environmental space. 
	- There are no sewer systems planned -- each house has its own sceptic system; can also be very dangerous; etc. When building suburbs, this is so 100s of people can live in the houses. Not desigend for traffic -- massive traffic problems.
	- Social isolation -- particular kind of space.
- In the New Deal period, you get a lot of ideology -- WPA, CC, etc. -- Roosevelt coming at you with ideology "promote confidence!" -- TVA, "electricity for all". Postwar period is different. Not a federal agency trying to provide you with a sense of values, bu tconsumerism -- buy stuff to make you happy, to reach a level of status, to make you feel good. Trying to find cultural value.
- Proliferation of plastics.
	- Plastics which had not really played much of a role in American life / economy before proliferate, largely remannts of war research
	- Bakelite -- an early plastic, a brittle and hard plastic
	- Changes becuase of WWII
	- Pre-war reputation for being cheap and inferior (to woods and metals)
	- Post-war spin on efforts by GE and other indutries to really promote plastics -- ligher weight, technologically innovative
	- Effort to naturalize plastics -- now that we've got it, we can do so much with it
	- Brownie Wise -- leaving advocate for Tupperware. Success story of post-war
	- Large-scale acceleration of packaging. Advertisements in the store. 
	- 1920s with mass production and consumption, you have department stores and grocery stores, in which the consumer gets their own products -- development of advertisements in these stores
	- A cereal box is a billboard -- now they are advertising at you
	- Massive amount of consumer products are in packages which are one-use, then throw out
	- Packaging becomes 1/3 of the waste stream and has increased by about 70% since 1960
- Landfills by 1960 and late 1970s -- landfills begin to proliferate over America and aren't regulated until they start causing problems. Issue -- landfills leak nasty stuff into the water and show up in water
	- Staten Island, NY -- largest landfill in the world by 1955
- Planned obsolescence
	- Market thinking and advertisement thinking throughout the economy
	- Finns on the backs of cars -- have no function, all about style. 
	- Car fashion -- designed to become obsolete
	- A way of manipulating consumer tastes by planning to keep things changing so consumers can keep up with what is the new thing now.
	- Creation of taste
	- Waste isbuilt into the system -- proliferation of landfills
	- Waste as a byproduct of the capitalist system -- increases standards of livign and produces commodities, sure; but much waste
	- What do people want to buy? Keeping up with the Joneses -- having good jobs which pay wages (purchasing power) which people can spend; we keep wages high so we can be consuming, which is a problematic relationship
- Highways
	- Cards are central to the economy and the suburban environment
	- Surbibanization is happening in many places in the world
	- Car culture is pretty unique to the US; the iea that your car becomes an expression about who you are as an individual; suburbs designed with cars and not busses in mind. Cars become central 
	- Henry Ford was in many ways an idealist; a particular vision of an ideal American society -- worker sshould be able to buy the products that they're building -- not egalitarian but a fair society in which people aren't slaving away; they can buy waht they produce. 
	- Fordlandia, Brazil
	- Cars have been central to the middle clas enviornment for a long timr -- definitely not an accident.=
- Oil -- no groweth wihthou it - 
- The government goes through a lot of funding to produce new things
- The new suburban house is now marketed heavily -- to rid it of the intruder
- Idea of being sold a chemically sterile, insect-free world. Being promoted as if the world is not right unless the insects are gone.
- Organophosphate deaths in the 1940s -- begin to see government regulation after deaths of factory and agricutlure workers are dying; indications that something is off.
- FIFRA (1947): starts as an attempt to protect consumers, turns out as a snake oil law -- no advertising if it doesn't work
- Murray Bookchin -- even in 1952 there is still revolutionary thinking: principle motive for chemicals and demands on frmland are imposed by the needs of profit and competition. 
- Viscose Rayon & CO2
	- Fllammable fabrics -- much more of this stuff than ever before
	- Flammables -- 6.4k people being killed a year by flammable fabrics and other consumer goods
	- Little kids' halloween costumes produced with Viscose Rayon
	- Clothing catches on fire so fast
	- Polyurethane foam -- put on furniture, referred to as 'solid gasoline'
	- Regulations on flammable fabrics -- Flammable Fabrics Act (1953)
	- Part of an American story: what is our fix? Never social or environmental confrontations to social or environmental problems: not by producing less flammable stuff, but rather alternative technologies -- tinkering with the technology so we cna continue to sell more
	- Chemical fire retardants
- Worker's health vs consumer satisfaction
	- Focused heavily on consumers -- the one group in Americna history which we have always struggled to come to terms with is industrial works -- this was never part of the American Dream; we don't celebrate the American industrial worker.
	- These sorts of topics are often a focus on the consumer
	- Carbon Disulfide -- as a consumer product, it's not very dangerous. But it is the workers who are producing this; inhaling it , touching it, etc.
	- Vinylchloride Monomer makes PVC pipes, which don't get regulation until the 1970s after OSHA is created
	- When they get regulated, it's for consumers -- not really for workers
- 1950s -- multiple-chemical sensitivity
	- Large gypsy moth problem in long island
	- Response -- DDT
	- Marjorie Spock -- lives with another woman who suffers from multiple-chemical sensitivity.
	- New York sprays DDT over their farm; Spock begins suing the state of New York because spraying their property. Begins as a property rights issue. What it becomes is more a sotry about public health. 
	- Attracts Rachel Carson
- Rachel Carson (1907 - 1964)
	- Biologist from Johns Hopkins
	- Is interested in these stories about nature and environmentalism
	- Silent Spring, 1962 -- investigations, meant to inspire women (targets of consumerism) and also pointing finger at the entymologists and other federal agents -- sterile, insect-free environments
	- Rising fears of nuclear way -- chemicals in consumers, health threats, etc.
	- Silent Spring makes a big splash; Kennedy reads it.
	- Criticizes post-war pesticides, USDA entomologists, the chemical industry, the intimacy between the state and the industry
	- Becomes influential in ecosystems ecology
	- Rachel Carson's book gets Kennedy thinking about the consumer bill of rights
- Reactions to Silent Spring
	- Smear campaign against Rachel Carson as a woman -- she can't be boht a scientist and a woman
	- Monsanto -- the desolate year, overrunning with insects if we don't use pesticides
	- Congress begins investigating
	- Kennedy creates an advisory committee
	- FIFRA act is improved a little bit to respond to these sorts of problems
- Kennedy's Consumer Bill of Rights in 1962 -- "consumers, by definition, includes us all"
- DDT Lawsuits: trucks sspraying DDT going down on people -- the kind of optimism and comformity that Ameircans have, we have faith that these sorts of things are safe or they can be saved -- not actuely toxic itself but not really questioned
	- No investigation about the interaction of multiple chemicals
- Environmental Defense Fund comes out of the DDT fight
- Nuclear science -- changing Americna society
- Strontium 90 -- what nuclear tests are doing to people. Strontium 90 is a byproduct of nuclear fission. Strontium 90 is like calcium; it attaches to bone, teeth, skin; we get strontium 90 in our bodies. 
- 1956 -- sound the alarm on this. Late 40s and early 50s, tos peak out against nuclear testing is a bit anti-American but mainstream politicians and people claiming that 10k people a day are dying from forms of radiation
- *On the Beach, 1957 + 1959. The nuclear cloud is coming for us
- Baby Teeth Experiment, 1959
	- Saint Louis -- look into the problem of strontium-90. Asking them to send children's baby teeth.
	- Collecting hundreds of thousands of baby teeth
	- Children born in St Louis in 1963 have 50x more Strontium 90 than in 1950
	- Results of nuclear testing are coming home
- By 1962, when the results of the baby teeth experiment and such are coming out, what before was a radical notion is now a thing which mainstream middle-American people are doing -- protesting against atmospheric testing
- 1963, Kennedy signs the partial nucelar test bans -- does not ban underground nuclear testing
- Middle-America's women are being targeted
- Ernest Dichter -- "One of the basic problems of prosperity, then, is to demonstrate that the hedonistic approach to life is a moral and not an immoral one." -- having a want and satisfying it is moral and not immoral. A change going on in the consumer economy. The single biggest cultural influence on Americna life is protestant Christian religion. 
- Greatest cultural influence today is consumerism -- even edating is consumer based (is this good enough?; shopping for a date)
- Values which used to be lodged into the consumer marketplace have moved into alternative places.
- For the advertisers and marketers, hedonism is necessary. Bush -- what can you do for your country? Go shopping.
- This idea that consumerism is good is not 'natural' -- it's historical, and emerges from a particular economy. Nothing is inevitable; decisions get made, and somehow we end up where we are. This swing in American life...
- 19th century, debt is something which Americans desperately try to stay away from (it makes you unfree); believed in moral values of hard work, etc. Dichter: turning to a hedonistic way of being, go satisfy all of your wants and desires.

## Lecture 5: Critique, Discontent, and Alternatives
The influences of African-American art-forms and the impulse to non-comformity helped to further fragment the 1960s as especially young people searched for alternate forms of expr

- God and reactions to Communism -- God-given vs natural-given, self-evident
- Turn towards unabashed consumerism challenges many previous morals
- We in many ways are more consumers than we are citizens -- who do very little to our political citizenship even though we consume daily.
- Conservatism, genuine -- technological conservatism, opposition to enamorment with consumerism
- Comformity of post-war enforced Ameircan values with patriotism, consumerism, etc.
- Critics of modern society -- Packard, the Hidden Persuaders / Risman, the Lonely Crowd -- cannot think for yourself.
- Critique of consumerism
- Galbraith -- focus on market satisfaction of produced desires
- Communism is set forth here -- enforcement of the mainstream
- Nuclear forces -- Oppenheimer expresses doubt on the hydrogen bomb exactly -- the philosophical metaphyisical conundrum, eventually accused of being a Communist
- The idea of "the Counterculture" -- the recent literature says that this is a horrible word to encompass much too many people. It is not a definition of a group. The 'counterculture' certainly directly challenges the mainstream, but there are many dimensions here. What about people out to have a good time, to smoke pot and listen to good music? This is not the same as movements with a political and philosophical edge. 
- Hippie movement lasts very short -- 18 months, consumerism culture gobblesd up hippieism.
- Expatriate writers
	- James Baldwin -- 1948, lived outside of the US. Felt could be more authentically himself outside of the US
	- Richard Wright, Arthur Himes -- novelists, critique from the outside of Ameircna society
- Allen Ginsburg, Howl. 1955. A centerpiece of the counterculture, articulating what that something which is wrong is. Becomes an intellectual keystone
- The Beats
	- Jack Keruoac -- being used and raw, On the Road -- non-comformity, no attachment, nomadic living
	- Keruac drank himself to death in 1969
	- Self indulgence and often a focus on male heroism -- felt that they had discovered an unfiltered freedom
	- Breaking boundaries in American life
	- Not everyone can go on the road -- women are often left behind. The solipsism of this poetry
	- William Bunourghe publishes a postmodern novel; nonlinear, meant to be opened anywhere. 
- 1950s to 1960s, Ameircnas are somewhat fine with drugs; many take drugs
- Jazz works alongside the beats; an admiration for Miles Davis, Bud Powell, etc. (beaten by police)
- Bebop -- a new form of jazz which is fast and loud, experimental, and exploratory
- Many of the Black jazz musicians faced greater freedom abroad than in America; Billy Holiday couldn't walk through the front door at the venue that she was playing at
- LSD captures the American imagination, particular in psychological circles -- advocated as a sort of miracle drug
- Public relations, marketing, advertising, and other kinds of political or social persuasion groups prop up
- Proliferation of psychology and psychiatry explode post-WWiI; people get jobs in ad firms and job firms, work for politicians
- Critique of the ways in which Americans are being persuaded to buy lots more stuff and what the effect of this is
- Critiques of conformity in the 1950s and 1960s
	- *The Lonely Crowd*: Americans couldn't think for themselves, too much falling into lockstep and doing what you're told. Isn't good for science, democracy, etc.
	- Not just about noncomformity but continuing to encouarage creative discovery
- Timothy Leary, experiments with LSD; LSD comes from Europe (Switzerland), sent to the US hoping it can be marketed
	- Leary becomes interested in it after taking it; finds illuminating results
	- Aldous Huxley experiments with LSD and acid; it breaks through some barriers
	- Leary begins to promote the use of LSD in a therapeutic way
	- Is let go from Harvard given his LSD experiments
	- Becomes the face of using LSD, acid
	- CIA is exprimenting with drugs -- how to keep people motivated and awaked; how to control human motivation and emotion -- the elements in them which can be turned into good soldiers
- Hipsters
	- The influence of African-American art forms -- (re)emergence of individuals linked to the beats and aesthetically and behaviorally to black art forms -- hipsters
	- Hipsters are dimensions of the market system -- go to the fringes of what is socially acceptable / marketable -- take from the fringes (Black art forms -- jazz, hight of eexperimental music), find what is good, and bring it to the mainstream
	- Emeergence of a 1950s - 1960s hipster type which is tied in with the beats -- Marlon Brando, *A Streetcar Named Desire*, James Dean, NOrman Mailer
	- An intentional working class affectation which is key to the hipster aesthetic -- playing around with working class stereotypes -- hipsters tend to come from middle to high class but take up these coded aesthetics
	- Love and theft -- like what they see in Black performances and want to take it -- this is the role of the hipster, to facilitate incorporaton
	- Norman Mailer writes "THe White Negro" about the emergence of the hipster searching for "an orgasm more apocalyptic than the one that preceded it"
	- Find the higher lifestyle from the fringes
	- Represent resistance to mainstream and modern society, but also feed modern society
	- Little Richard $$\to$$ Pat Boon $$\to$$ Elvis Presley: brings rock and roll to the mainstream, draws much from Black roots, plays with gender -- a synthetic character
- Hipters and beasts, adjacents
	- Sam Shepard, prolific playwright -- mid-60s plays, continues to write 12, 13 plays a year being put in off-broadway shows
	- Ed Sanders 
	- Hunter S. Thompson -- 'gonzo' journalist -- inserted himself into his stories and the lives he was writing about
	- Breaking free of the standard molds of playwriting, music, etc. All of these become somewhat cult figrues -- not cult figures but are bringing in new audiences
- Challenges to conformity
	- Humor and satire become very important
	- Mad Magazine and Cracked -- 1952 and 1958, introduce satire to a sterile American society
	- Britain -- Monty Python, making fun of the British empire. Satire of the Royal Family, of empire, etc.
	- Dr. Strangelov, Stanley Kubrick -- paradoxes of the nuclear deterrent -- that we develop weapons to never use them; you lose if you win
	- By the 1960s, satire is an established tradition
- The folk movement
	- Founded in individuals like Pete Seeger, travels around and plays a lot of music
	- Concentration on 'folk' -- supposed to be the music of the people
	- Peter Seeger reflecting on the IWW -- unionism and togetherness, stirring up the people
	- Utah Phillips
	- Bob Dylan comes of age in the 20s; recalls the communist influence of the 1930s labor activism -- particularly Woody Guthrie
	- Reflecting on the 1930s labor activism, critique of the government
	- Joan Baez, Phil Ochs, Bob Dylan
	- Attract a large following along college students -- articulating key dimensinos of their life; being led into a new expressive space
	- Bob Dylan, Newport Folk Festival 1965 -- plugs into the guitar to the amp guitar and plays electrical guitar, people booed him; felt betrayed that this creative musician had gone 'sellout' -- this moment is defining for how people say the folk movement and Bob Dylan
- Conformity of the post-war decade alienated some Americans who turned to critique, alternative lifestyles, and art forms for a wide range of motivations, from self-satifaction to social and political commentary.
- A search for authenticity

## Lecture 6: Kennedy and the Cold War
Kennedy's short tenure as Presdient showed him to be a Cold Warrior who was ready to fight the spread of communism, but his experiences in office altered his political rhetoric by 1963 to a focus on world peace.

- Cuban missile crisis -- changes the focus of American and Soviet foreign policy; brings the US and USSR in close nuclear conflict
- A change of focus and the big ideals
- Goes into the presidency in 1961 -- has to play tough with communism -- only way to politically stay afloat, way more military spending than Eisenhower, stares down the soviet
- Near the end of his life, he changes his tune -- the Cuban Missle Crisis
- THe US in Latin America
	- Since the early 19th century, the Munro doctrine to the focus on growing fruit and bananas throughout latin America, it has remained very important
	- Part of what Kennedy proposes is the Peace Corps -- alternative to military service, still counts as service but you go to a part of the world and build houses or schools
	- Alliacne for progress -- looks like New Deal policies -- farmers demonstrating new farming techniques -- more technological sophistication than existed in Latin America otherwise, like the Truman doctrin e-- people on the fence about Communism, bringing them into our sphere by doing something good.
	- The carrot -- lure the poeple towards you
	- The stick -- the School of the Americas (Western Hemisphere Instittue for Security Coopertion) -- set up after WWII in the Panama Canal zone -- US has a lease of the Panama Canal zone. Trains right wing militias to fight leftists throughout Latin America. Becomes the other part of the peace corps -- the part which will beat you. People here will be responsible for Che Guevara
- John F. Kennedy
	- An important part of his image as a new president in 1971 is to be a cold warrior, will not be weak on communism
	- "paya ny price, bear any burden" -- the US will unconditionally stand up tot eh USSR
	- Gets massive budgets for military spending; Eisenhower was a fiscal conservative, much lower than Truman's and certainly Kennedy's.
	- Kennedy beefs up the military much for flexible response -- not just relying on US nuclear deterrent, but conventional forces which can be built up in other ways
	- Eisenhower, New Look -- fueling nuclear deterrent. For Kennedy and his advisors, too many small conflicts -- things sorted out without nuclear weapons
	- Alternative fallout shelters and missile systems
	- Focus on stopping wars of 'national liberation' -- stopping leftist and nationalist efforts funded by communist states like China and the USSR in Cuba, Vietnam, Laos, the Congo -- Kennedy sees a coming war of national liberation and wants to stop it
	- Creation of Navy SEALs and a large focus on expanding the Army Green Berets
	- Inspirational to young americans
- Foreign policy
	- The arms race and the space race -- not wanting to lose to the Soviets
	- soviets already put a satellite in space,so the US would rush to put a man on the moon
	- Flexible response military policy -- much more spending (Helicopters in Vietnam -- major mode of transportation)
	- Cuba -- dealing with Castro -- secretly, plotting out many different ways to get Castro out of power
- "Best and Brightest" -- the advisers and cabinets
	- Drawn from many places who were not necessarily traditional Washington fixtures
	- Considered many mainstay figures in teh Democratic Party 
	- Kennedy goes with a lot of young guys -- nontraditioalists
	- Robert McNamara -- president of Ford motor company, now runs the defense department
		- Capital and the state -- head of Ford to head of the defense departmetn to head of the international bank
	- Maxwell Taylor -- WWII general, part of joint chiefs
	- McGeorge bundy and Walt Rostow -- policy wonks, out of universities -- writers, poly sci, put out of university jobs into government -- presumably smart guys not tainted by Washington history -- hopefully shape things up and be creative
	- Robert Kennedy is the Attorney General and one of John Kennedy's closest advisors
	- Walt Rostow -- architect and defender of the Vietnam War
- Liberal domestic agenda
	- Got a lot of heat from the Democratic Party for not having much of a domestic agenda, large focus on foreign policy
	- Big area of domestic policy (Civil Rights) -- Kennedy is not going near for political viability, trying to get elected again in 64; trying to keep conservatives happy
	- Not too much by civil rights
	- Style over substance -- commission on the status of women, inspires a number of states to do the same -- several other domestic agenda victories in Congress
	- Addressing economic changes
	- Manpower development and training act -- retraining for workers being replaced by automation -- deindustrialization, a lot of direct automation
	- Area Redevelopment Act -- going into poor regions and trying to fix endemic economic problems. Wide swathes of the country remain without electricity, running water, illiteracy, etc. Also resisted by the people there to a certain extent, overall campaigns are not very scuccessful

Part I: Cuba
- US maintains spy plane initiatives (U-2) to high at high altitudes and spy on many places -- see if countries are stockpiling weapons
- Eisenhower's policy -- Open Skies Policy, both being aware they are spying on each other to address tensions between the US and Soviet
- Planes could be shot down -- 1960, by the USSR, held the pilot and then released him to the US, became a bit embarrasing for the US and the UN
- Castro and Cuba
	- Nationalists / Communists movement in 1959, Cuban Revolution, government under Castro
	- Try to embarrass the US a lot at the UN
	- Organization of American states (Western Hemispheric organization), trying to embarrass the US about civil rights and the US position in the world
	- For Kennedy this is a major policy focus in secret -- CIA works on how to get rid of Castro
	- When Kennedy comes into office they've already got the Bay of Pigs plans drawn up by the Eisenhower administration, laying there for Kennedy to sign. Kennedy agrees to sign it.
	- Allen Dulles -- head of the CIA. 
	- Use Cuban exiles -- train them up (about 1400) -- send them in to start a grassroots movement and install a different leader
	- Will this be a slow groing grassroots insurgency or a straightforward invasion? 
	- For Kennedy, a slow grassroots insurgency; limited US assistance; do not want US military getting involved; pledges air support
- Bay of Pigs
	- 1961 -- OKs Bay of Pigs invasion
	- Ends up a disaster
	- Castro and the Cubans knew it was coming and were ready for it
	- Kennedy had promised air spport on the second day and pulled it back -- left the Cuban exiles stuck in there
	- Depended on a grassroots revolt in Cuba which did not materialize -- the US is often incorrect in its belief that people who live in Communist countries hate their leadership and love to see the country overthrown. "the people want democracy"
	- Reality is somewhat different, perhaps for many different reasons -- often no big grassroots movement against Castro
	- Those who were not killed were captured
	- Bay of Pigs becomes a major embarrassment for Kennedy -- first foreign policy decision, and it is a failure
	- one black eye just coming in by a low margin
	- Cuban exiles continue to see Kennedy as a traitor (conspiracy theories about Cuban exile involvement in assassination)
	- Continue to work on how to oust Castro
- Operation Mongoose
	- Covert plot to kill Castro
	- All sorts of crazy ways to get rid of Castro
	- Robert Kennedy and Allen Dulles working on this
	- Pushed Castro closer to the Soviets -- knew he was being targeted and hew as facing off against the US, began to seek out more help from the USSR
	- Castro didn't want to be a Soviet satellite (wanted to be independent) but become closer to the Soviets
- 1961 -- Berlin Wall erected overnight. Germany is still occupied -- West (democratic) and East (USSR). Berlin, in East Germany, is divided. The wall goes up which will stay there until 1989, 1990.
	- Kennedy gets blamed for this -- on his watch the Soviets have erected a wall through Berlin which is a barrier of anyone trying to go west. Becomes a major talking point in speeches -- the ways in which the Soviets shoot people trying to get over the wall. 
	- becomes the best symbolf ro anti-democratic forces
	- Puts the focus on Berlin squarely in the Cold War
	- If the US attacked Cuba, the Soviets would surely roll into West Berlin; the US would be pulled into a conflict
	- Berlin becomes a major focus -- the city itself become sa symbol
- 1962, Cuban missle crisis
	- U2 flights over Cuba demonstrate that in fact the Soviet Union is putting nuclear missiles in Cuba, 100 miles off the US coast
	- Believe they are medium-range ballistic missiles, but in fact they are intermediate-range
	- Missiles being constructed, programmed, erected by Soviet personnel -- large numbers of Soviet soldiers in Cuba
	- Attacking Cuba a bad idea -- leading to war
- Soviet Missiles in Cuba (1962)
	- MRBM -- medium range
	- IRBM -- can reach virtually everywhere in the US (except Seattle!)
	- From the US side, how to use tactical nuclear weapons -- smaller nuclear weapons, meant to blow up a hole so the army can roll through
	- Kennedy's joint chief of staff -- really want an invasion of Cuba during this time
	- Kennedy's ears -- one voice, we must invade Cuba (military does not want to not get rid of Castro)
- This is the crisis for 13 days -- people watched on the news, how are we going to get out of this
- Cuban Missile Crisis, 1962
	- People are fearful -- building bomb shelters, raiding grocery stores, protesting
	- Fearful that this will come to a strong nuclear conflict
	- Consequentially, Kennedy and Khushev couldn't really talk to each other -- ambassador to ambassador, department to department. Getting communiques which are supported to be from Khushchev, but maybe not really Khushchev saying these things -- communication breakdowns and problems
- Kennedy's solution: military quarantine of Cuba
	- Naval ringing of Cuba with ships
	- A blocakde is technically an act of war, so called a quarantine
	- Gave the Soviets a chance to step back -- if they wanted to run the blockade we would have to figure out what to do next
	- Becomes a chess match (symbolic -- US vs Soviet Union)
	- Most ships stopped going to Cuba -- a deep breath, yes we haven't shot down ships
- Military decisions
	- A lot of stuff happened in these 13 days
	- Many decisions brought us closer to war
	- Major Robert Anderson's U2 was shot down and was killed
	- Cubans shot at US recon planes 
	- U2 flight accidentally flew over Soviet airspace in Siberia
	- General Power set DEFCON 2 from DEFCON 3 with no authorization (US military goes into all sorts of heightened preparation)
	- Atomic energy commission -- totally not on the same page as the politics, in the south pacific doing new nuclear weapon
	- Pushing the pressure towards war
- Resolution
	- Khushchev not trying to start WWIII
	- The US negotiates a settlement with the Soviets
	- US will secretly take its missiles out of Turkey (old Jupiter missiles)
		- Could not do this publicly
	- Soveits took their missiles out of Cuba
	- Hot line in the White House with USSR
	- Cold War cools; kennedy focuses on not gettin gin this situation again
- Space Program: Geminini (1961)
	- Mercury program -- testing different spacecraft, leads to the Gemini program
	- Test methods of space travel and mechanics
	- LEO -- Low Earth Orbits
	- Kennedy has the Apollo program slated later

Part 2: Containment in Vietnam
- Ho Chi Minh - major force in Vietnam, patriotic leader, works with the OSS -- Office of Strategic Services (predecessor to the CIA)
- Fighting the Japanese -- the US and Vietnam
- Trying to kick the Japanese out of Indochina
- After the war, one of our closest allies (France) wanted to go back and get the Vietnamese colony back
- The US supported this to avoid a taking back of communism
- This begins the very long Vietnam Wars
- From the Vietnamese perspective, at war for >30 years
- French in Indochina: 1945 - 1954
	- Don't want to be ruled by the French
	- Overthrow of colonial movements
	- Viet Minh -- national Liberation Front (NLF) 
	- In the South, you have many French influences and Anti-communists -- this is who is fighting against Ho Chi Minh adn the nationalists / communists
- US Policy -- NSC-68, containment policy
	- Gets the US interested in Vietnam
	- Neutrality until 1950 -- because of the Korean War etc., the US begins moving closer to supporting the French with money and weapons
	- Truman under presusre to push against the Vietnamese because of the 'loss of China' under his watch
	- Truman focuses more in Vietnam
	- Truman -- "We are fighting in Korea for our own national security and survival". Same argument will be made about Vietnam. This will not be received well by Americans
	- We get in Southeast Asia Truman's multi-million dollar aid program
	- Adivers in the Vietnam War  -- personel going to Vietnam to train the Vietnamese
- US Policy
	- Eisenhower: seeing Southeast Asia as many dominos in the domino theory
	- Dogmatic belief by the mid fifties in the domino theory
	- If you let one go, all will fall -- (broken windows theory?)
- 1954, French Defeat by the Viet Minh at Dien Bien Phu, Indochina
	- The french believed they had good allies and modern weaponry + good trainig,s hould be winning
	- They were fighting an entrenched and dedicated enemy
	- Vo Nguyen Giap
	- French defeat -- the US must figure out what must happen next in Vietnam
- Communsit leadership
	- Changesa re going on in Vietnam itself
	- Ho Chi Minh is getting older -- becomes more of a symbolic figure ('Uncle Ho') -- relates to the common man, becomes a symbolic father
	- Real power moving into Le Duan; not there durnig the jockeying of power, which leaves him clean. Well opsitioned to rise to the top.
	- Americans are totally focused on Ho Chi Minh -- Americans know him and use him in propaganda -- talk about him like Castro, the single figurehead in Vietnam. But Ho Chi Minh is moving out of the picture. Americans do not know who Le Duan is
	- The US does not know a lot about Vietnam -- but maintains a large amount of arrogance that they know what i will be about
		- Arrogance + ignorance
	- Guys in the North are consolidating power, supporting more of the guirreula powers
- Vietnam: Divison of Indochina (1954)
	- Division at the 17th parallel -- temporary division of the coutnry until a new government can be put in there
	- Rival groups with totally different visions for what will happen in Vietnam -- unified under a communist or anticommunist flag
	- Laos -- 3-party Civil War. US backs one of them
- War and peace under Eisenhower
	- US government begins supporting Ngo Dinh Diem, who rises to power in southern Vietnam
	- Geneva Summit in 1955, not much gets decided about Vietnam, but new conversations between Khushchev and Eisenhower about collective security -- SEATo, Baghdad Pact (1954 and 1955)
- SOuth Vietnam
	- Ngho Dinh Diem is an unfortunate ally -- aligned with the french as many of the Vietnamese bureaucrats were; converted to Catholicism
	- Are authoritarian -- many people who take over in post-colonial states are authoritarian
	- Diem's authority is a rule by police squads and arrests
	- Ngo Dinh Nhu -- brother -- runs a lot of this stuff
	- Madame Nhu -- sometimes compared with Jackie Kennedy, a colorful personality
	- Southern Vietnam in an authoritarian party, and this is now our ally -- rule from a position of privilege rather than populism
- Kennedy's Policies
	- Kennedy gets in power, what does he do?
	- Getting involved further in Vietnam
	- Laos -- Kennedy and Khushchev take part with 13 other nations in getting involved in Laos and settling a compromise government which doesn't allow the government to devolve into further civil war
	- Seen by Kennedy's opponents as a loss -- couldn't beat them in Laos
	- Vietnam, increases American advisors doing training and military advising
	- Beginning of special fofrces type operations -- sabotoge, psychological warfare, recon, training SV forces in these tactics
	- Lots of US equipemnt is going into Vietnam
	- Disturbing discoveries in Vietnam -- Ngo Diem Dinh's rule is not good -- McNamara and Taylor, almost impossible to win the war. It is grim starting 1962/3. The government from Truman to Kennedy to Johnson will tell the American people very different stories than the private discussion
	- 1963 -- 16k advisors, are going into operations, are getting involved in combat operations -- 500 casualities
	- Few voices in Kennedy's administration. George Ball gives a prescient remark on getting too deep into it; Kennedy dismisses this
- Special forces: counter-insurgency
	- The US put a lot of effort into training for war; got sunk more into Vietnam
	- Green Berets -- important role in Vietnam, did a lot of going into the mountains and training tribal people to be armies for the South
	- By 1963, a large number of special forces -- 950 Green Berets
- 1963 -- Vietnam: State and Society
	- American ignorance about Vietnamese society
	- State and soceity did not look like one another
	- Southern Vietnam is going through a chain of bad leaders after Diem -- only worsening
	- Madame Ngu -- jokes about the Buddhists protesting anti-Buddhist policies ('barbeque in the street')
	- Buddhists being pushed out of power and site sof worship closed; massive demonstrations of Buddhists and students against the Catholic rulers; universities etc. closed
	- Massive protests against the government the US is dedicated to backing -- a losing proposition since 1963
- World peace
	- Kennedy's turn towards world peace, part of his legacy
	- After the Cuban Missile Crisis, a politician which undergoes change
	- Rousing speeches on world peace
- Assassinations of November 1963
	- A US backed coup sings off on ousting Diem and his brother -- now a long chain of worse leaders.
	- November 63, John Kennedy is assassinated and Lyndon B. Johnson
	- New leader of South Vietnam: Khahn

## Lecture 7: Civil Rights -- Policy and Activism During 1964 and 1965
- On the response paper -- do not write body paragraph 1 (one document), body paragraph 2 (one document), etc. Least analytic, least interesting, least useful thing you can do -- bring documents in combination wiht each other
- Argument: The height of the Civil Rights movmeent brought policy changes and helped to alter American politics of both the left and right as well as creating a new pluralist America.
- Organizations
	- There are number of organizations working together now
	- NAACP, CORE, SCLC, SNCC, VEP
	- Albany, Georgia -- they don't get along well for integration methods, and this works against their overall mission
	- NAACP is a lot of lawyers -- courts and courtcases; CORE is a more activist group (freedom rides); SNCC does a lot of student-centered stuff.
- Protesting for Civil Rights
	- After the 1954 Brown v. Board ruling
	- Desegregation -- local and interstate services, schools, busses, wade-ins
	- Massive resistance -- White Southerners' campaign of resistance to not integrate in the South
	- Voting rights -- produces a lot of violence and why Mississippi comes to be known as 'Mississippi burning'
	- 1957 Civil Rights Act -- an act in Congress which really gets watered down through compromise and ends up as a suffrage act which tries to make it illegal to discriminate against 'qualified' Black voters.
	- Greatest violence in rural areas and counties in Mississippi, Alabama, etc.; almost nobody votes; anyone who votes, is usually in cities (might be small populations)
- Voter Education Project -- 1962 to 1964
	- Attempt to get more poeple registered to vote
	- Across the American South, trying to get people to register to vote, this is what produces a bunch of violence across the South 
- Voting Rights
	- By 1964, results in about 700k new Black voters -- from 29% to 43% of adult Black voters nationally
	- Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama -- face a lot of challenges to try and get people to vote
	- 1964 in Mississippi -- less than 7% of adult Black people could vote
	- 1965 voting rights act
- School Integration
	- Because of Brown v. Board, schools should be integrated -- but there is massive resistance
	- James Meredith registers at Ole. Miss, Oxford Mississippi (Oxford Town, Bob Dylan) at 1962 -- a riot ensues where two people are killed and 375 people are injured
	- Kennedy dispatched federal troops (30k) to keep this in hand
	- MLK: "To take a moderate approach, hoping to get whit ehelp, doesn't help. They nail you to the cross and it saps the enthusiasiam of followers. You've got to have a crisis."
	- Kennedy is trying to keep his hands off; MLK realizes that only by provoking a crisis can you get places -- this is where you get non-violent protesters putting their bodies on the line (sacrifices?)
- George Wallace
	- Governor of Alabama
	- Significant because of what he teaches Richard Nixon -- on an anti-integration pattern / segregationist platform, he can get the 'Solid South' behind him
	- This changes the South being controlled by the Democrats to the Republicans
	- University of Alabama, 1963 -- admitting Vivian Malone and James Hood -- Gov. George Wallace stands in the door to prevent integration. 
	- A highly staged and publicized event -- the fact that it becomes a media circus works in many ways -- galvanizes segregationists behind Wallace but also shows other Americans what is happening in the South.
	- Wallace is breaking federal law -- he gets lots of political attention -- a white leader breaking the law vs. black people breaking the law -- they don't even have to protest to go into jail.
	- Robert Kennedy as the AG: sherrifs say that if they think there will be a riot, they will first arrest the black people.
- Birmingham, AL
	- After the Civil War, Birmingham is one of the few Southern cities where there is an effort to invest a lot of capital to create an industrial town by Northern industrialists
	- Effort to create Northern-style factory work, union jobs, etc. -- Birmingham at the center of this investment
	- After 1900 -- Birmingham stands out as a unique southern town
	- Even though it is industrial, white unions control a lot of the labor; black people remain the second class and remain on the outside
	- Birmingham becomes an important place to take a stand. A lot of Black folks who have a stake in civil rights -- it becomes a focal point for Civil Rights
	- Held in check by Bull Connor -- the sheriff who rules with an iron fist in Birmingham, does not mind sending out dogs and fire hoses to attack and subdue people
	- Through 1963, Birmingham became a very violent place, including bombings, such as one which killed four young girls
	- People start to see well-trained protesters standing up against physical attacks by police
	- Kennedy begins to change his tone in Civil Rights -- May 1963
- Medgar Evers
	- June 11: JFR finally pronounces Civil Rights as a moral issue
	- Medgar Evers assassinated in his home
	- JFK had made a speech about how civil rights was a moral issue as clear as the scriptures and the US Constitution -- starting to be interested in standing up for Civil Rights
	- Evers worked on many issues, including wade-ins in Gulf Areas of Mississippi, investigating Emmett Till's murder, works with the NAACP in Missisippi
	- Killed by a sniper in his home -- one of the assassinations which will lead to the November 63 assassination of JFK
- August 1963: march on Washington for Jobs and Freedom
	- Almost 250k people -- NAACP, SCLC< etc.
	- Come out to protest what is happening in America in terms of race
	- MLK gives the central galvanizing speech on race in America
- A New President
	- Kennedy is assassinated in Dallas, Texas in November
	- Lyndon Johnson -- brings his own focus on Civil Rights to bear in his presidency
	- Johnson is ambitious -- a long-time lawmaker and policy-maker, has a lot of influence in Congress, quite political successful; from Texas
	- A colorful personality
	- Johnson comes out of the New Deal tradition -- in the mold of FDR -- believed it was the federal government which could be used to start to change American life in important ways -- how to put a stamp on the country? At a pivotal time in American presidency where we can make change
	- Johnson is set up well to become one of the longest serving presidents (two terms changed after FDR) -- Johnson can finish Kennedy's term and can run for two more terms
	- Johnson has a moment to put a massive mark on the future of hte country
	- The Great Society -- a continuation of New Deal ideas -- using the power of the federal government to get into and change lives for the better
	- Centerpiece of the Great Society -- the war on poverty
	- Post WWII, war becomes the American mode of combat for everything -- war of poverty, war on drugs, etc.
	- Pricey government programs to fix black and white poverty
	- A democrat from Texas: has some cred here, is a southerner, has some credit here -- gets some people to follow him on the idea of the Great Society
	- Not just that some groups will resist this (a centerpiece of conservatism -- resisting government programs) but what destroys Johnson and these programs is the Vietnam War.
	- Johnson tries to fight two wars at once, does both of them badly, and loses boht of them
	- It is rare for a sitting president to not run for a second term -- but he is so defeated by 1968 that he does not even run for president -- when he doesn't run for president, he smokes again, pus on 20 more pounds, and is dead by 1973. Johnson's presidency with hope and promise will become completely derailed by the Vietnam War.
- Wallace shows Nixon -- the South can vote as a bloc, and this is politically significant for taking back the South for the Republicans
- LBJ -- a racist? The trends are already there that black voting can be key to political victories. Even Eisenhower had increased his proportion of black voters. Part of it is pure political animalism. But this is also the direction of the US. LBJ has no respect for the Vietnamese for instance.
- LBJ sees Civil Rights as politically expedient
- Civil Rights Act of 1964 -- passed in Congress
	- Questions about its longevity -- is it still relevant?
	- Prohibits the kinds of discrimination we see in schools as well as privately onwed institutions. 
	- The South got away with discrimination via public/private divide: the 14th amendment doesn't apply to private institutions
	- Includes discrimination based on sex, which is an interesting development. Many employers continue to discriminate on the basis of sex. Made a big stink about the law saying that we should have male playboy bunnies, etc. -- in their minds, work was divided by gender / sex anyway.
	- The '64 act did not mention voting -- a major issue which Civil Rights folks wanted
- Freedom Summer (1964)
	- Across the American South, a lot of people in the South begin registering to vote --going into rural areas and getting Black people registered to vote
	- Unleashed another wave of violence in the south.
	- Hundreds of volunteers in the North coming down -- many were white, some were also black -- the response is multiple bombings, beatings, shootings, and other forms of violence.
	- THree specific murders -- the Mississippi bruning case -- one black and two white volunteers going to register voters and were murdered by the KKK
	- The federal government tries to keep its hand out of local cases but there was here a massive hunt for the bodies and the killers
	- In rural places, volunteers are setting up freedom schools -- being educated so they can read and start to vote, being more politically involved.
- Democratic Convention -- Atlantic City, New Jersey (1964)
	- Picking who is going to run for president
	- Delegation to Mississippi is dominated by whites
	- Delegations go to the convention and try to get the candidate they like elevated to the person running for president
	- Group of African-American activists form the Mississippi Freedom Democratic party (MFDP) -- trying to be seated at the 1964 convention -- but they were turned away because thye were black. Gave them two seats in the convention. Refused these seats. Afterwards, the news media began to interview some of threse folks.
		- Fannie Lou Hamer -- local activist in Mississippi, lost her job for being too much of an activist.
		- Began talking with the media about her experience in Mississippi
		- What she had to say was being viewed on national media
		- Fannie Lou Hamer becomes a voice of the struggle going on in Mississippi at the Democratic Convention
- Republican Convention 
	- Significant -- Barry Goldwater from Arizona rises to the top of the American field of candidates
	- From Arizona is significant: a place of grassroots conservatism in the country, referred to as the 'Sun Belt' -- Orange County and Arizona across the warm states of the South
	- Demonstrates George Wallace's success, that he had brought together the southern states under a segregationist platform.
	- What might be possible if they had gotten involved?
	- How do use coded language which indicates segregation by talking about the fderal government's overreach, etc. Bringing together the core of the deep south
	- Barry Goldwater fired up a lot of people, including young conservatives voting for the same time -- excited about Barry Goldwater. A transitional figrue here getting to Nixon. 
	- *The Conscience of a Conservative* (1960) -- articulates these new conservative ideas.
	- Has cred with the south that he voted against the 1964 Civil Rights act; really targets Kennedy's Great Society -- targets the welfare state, social security, etc.
	- "Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice"
- Selma march for voting rights
	- Now the Civil Rights movement is focused on voting
	- Selma, Alabama -- famous march over the bridge
	- A small percentage of blacks could vote -- becomes a centerpiece for new voting laws
	- TV cameras are rollinig with massive violence, thrust at these marchers who are nonviolent and unarmed
	- American s are watching protesters being beaten up
	- It is not uncommon in America for average Ameircans "the white moderate"  to look at this and think "the black people have still done something wrong for this to have happened" -- and this is a feeling which takes a long time to work out -- the Kennedys had to change their position for this, etc.
	- Surely it cannot be as simple as beating up nonviolent protesters.
	- "Go slow" -- Kennedy and the later white Americans -- take it slow, American society isn't ready yet -- a lot of pushback against this from the white moderate
	- In 1965, Voting Rights Act
		- idea for black people to vote dates from reconstruction
		- If black people didn't have voting rights, they would enver have equal citizenship -- Douglas, effort since post Civil War
		- Selma is the final moment before the Voting Rights Act is passed in 1965
		- 24th amendment: ends the poll tax (pay to vote), literacy tests, etc.
		- 25 Black people are elected in the South in 1964; there are over 700 in 1970
- Black power / Black militancy
	- Impact of the 1964 Democratic Convention
	- High point of the Black power movement isn't quite there yet 
	- Malcolm X is a fringe figure, a radical -- belongs to a radical organization for most of his life (Nation of Islam)
	- Mainstream Americans are uncomfortable with Malcolm X
	- 1964 DC central to rise of black power: it is clear that African-Americans are still going to rmeain on the outside of political power
	- Malcolm X talk about Black indpeendence movements -- not being connected to whites anymore; breaking free, enough is enough.
	- Jim Brown (football player) -- becomes one of the many faces of the black pwoer movement
	- SNCC begins to turn towards more black inependence and black militancy -- begins to purge white counterparts -- wanted them out. =
	- Malcolm X becomes so central -- very articulate and intelligent, is debating with people -- Blacks will have to be more militant, stop just asking for table scraps, demand independence
	- 1965: dissaffected member of the Nation of Islam kills Malcolm X after he left that organization
	- Muhammad Ali -- won the Olympics at a young age
		- One of the great characters of American history
		- Ali would say 'outrageous' things -- much charisma and humor, became a face of the black power and black militancy movement
		- Joined the Nation of Islam, becmae a Muslim in 1961
		- Cassius Clay -- a name which comes from slavery, gets rid of these names from legacies of slavery -- changes to Muhammad Ali
		- Becomes to educate himself -- black people have no knowledge of *themselves* -- understand 'roots', 'self', etc.
		- 1966: supposed to report for the draft, absolutely refuses
		- Goes to jail for 3 years
- Immigration Reform
	- Since 1924, the US had a quite draconian immigration law -- 1924, the height of xenophobia and racism in America
	- 1924 cut off immigration from Asia and established a quota system -- quota numbers are determined from census data from the 19th century  -- really priviliged Northern and Western Europe
	- Hart-Cellar Act of 1965, a championship for immigration reform
		- Looked bad for the US -- main motviation
		- An aspect of the Great Society
	- Ends Asian exclusion, quotas, and other restrictions
	- Makes a general number from any place on Earth -- what this means is that immigrant from Nigeria has just a good chance of getting in as someone from Norway
	- Limited Western hemisphere immigration to 120k; Mexico and Central America will send many immigrations over across the decades
		- Creates a new category of 'illegal aliens' which becomes very significant
		- People come for agricultural war
		- Brosero program has gone on for over 20 years -- people come and go for agricultural work -- will continue to be an issue
	- Effects
		- Allows more immigrants in than in previous periods
		- Many immigrants are refugees from communism
		- A lot more people in the Caribbean and Asia, as well as Latin America
		- Suggests that the laws being passed are favoring a more pluralist American society -- one which is less overtly white
		- The 'browning' of America
- Urban unrest on the horizon -- 1964 and 1965, dark clouds on the horizon in terms of what is happening
	- 64 & 65 laws have been passed, significant and not to be understated -- but they don't change things from day to day
	- Harlem in 64, Watts in 65 -- both places explode with extreme racial unrest in places caused by police who stopped young black men
	- Massive unrest, damage, violence, and so on -- a signal of what is to come in the next few years
	- 67 -- the long hot summer; over 100 American cities will look somewhat similar
- Sum up
	- Activism has its triumphs and limitations
	- Fracturing of the movement was like the 1960s more broadly
	- JOhnson administration's new policies establish a new liberalism and the backlash tot hose policies a new conservatism.

## Lecture 8: The Great Society
Argument: The Great Society was a response to prosperity. it was a vision of a more generally prosperous America that would use the power of the federal government to solve economic and social problems.
- End of LBJ's term as presdiency, the White House puts more than 200 bills through Congress -- big Democratic majority and gets a lot of legislation through; some of it lingers, such as medicaid / medicare
- Great Society -- response to prosperity -- we're doing well but a good portion of the country has been left behind -- but this is also what irritates Reagan -- when it was a response to depression, spending is fine; but not as a response to prosperity. The government should not be taking money from one group of people and giving it to others.
- When Nixon gets elected in 68, Nixon actually keeps it going -- it's pretty popular. In the 80s a lot of it gets cleaved away.
- The Great Society
	- Help for poor Americans, the elderly
	- Great Society -- focused on both black and whites, supposed to be for everyone
	- New Deal lacked significantly in terms of race because Roosevelt needed the Southerners
	- Johnson thinks of himself as carrying on Kennedy's legacy ; wants to use Kennedy's name political as much as he can
	- Influenced significantly by *The Affluent Society* (Galbraith) and others
	- Galbraith became part of the administration (ambassador to India) and later an advisor to Johnson
	- *The Affluent Society* -- all of this focus on private gain and wealth and jobs and income, etc., we are missing out on opportunities to do public projects which will help more people. Johnson is taking from this and saying we should do more publc 
	- LBJ played heavily on drawing on Roosevelt and the New Deal
	- New deal inspired -- take this overseas to Vietnam. Same thing US is doing elsewhere also -- social uplift / infrastructure projects
	- 1964 in the fall elections; Johnson is elected but there is also a solid Dem majority in Congress, which allows Johnson to send bill after bill to Congress
- The War on Poverty
	- A focus on absence of skills and needs for job training + education
	- LBJ didn't want direct aid (welfare)
	- Food Stamps (1961) -- one form of direct aid, but coupled with a tax cut for the middle and high class
		- Johnson sees the pitfalls here -- programs focus on uplifting people and not just wealth distribution
	- A 'hand up', not a 'hand out'
	- Begins / accelerates a national conversation about working hard, deserving, meritocracy, origins of poverty, lack of success
- *The Other America*, Michael Harrington (1962)
	- Authoritative voice -- Michael Harrington, University Professor and influential in the Kennedy administration -- talking about 'the other america'
	- 40 to 50 million Americans who are invisible to the rest of the country, living in deep poverty
	- Promoting the conscience constituency -- fellow countrymen
	- Gets debated constantly; it's well-done and researched, becomes a lightning rod for different sides of the issues
- Connecting poverty to a lack of freedom
	- If not taking part in properity, if not accessing basic services, are you *in fact free*?
	- Comes up by people who are critical of hte system: you oare unde the humb of work that you don't enjoy any of the prosperity in the country
	- The need for a soical safety net so Americans don't fall below a certain value
	- Economic liberty -- the way American freedom is getting defined is less about your political contributions / poliitcal citizenship and more about what you can enjoy and afford economically because of the money you make / the family you belong to. Economic liberty is a centerpiece of Johnson's claim. People need to be able to make a living wage an achieve soical status
- Experiencing poverty
	- LBJ talking about all sorts of groups of Americans, not letting race be unmentioned
	- "We seek not just equality as a right and a theroy, but equality as a fact and as a result"
	- Division on responsibility for lack of success
- Economic opportunity
	- Wnat to put emphasis on the right topics -- economic opportunity bcomes an important buzzphrase for the Johnson administration
	- 1964 Economic Opportunity Act -- helpes to create the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) -- see if people are being discriminated against in hiring
	- Supposed to be about both sex and race, but not being paid  alot of attention
	- What are Americans able to talk about? It perhaps is sex and gender which maybe is the hardest for Americans to get their head around
	- Expectation that this will be taken seriously is not followed by many people
	- Many new laws which speak exactly to gender discrimination
	- Office of Economic Opportunity
	- Locally oriented Community Action Agencies (CC)
	- Helping people with job training, finding jobs, getting jobs, not being discriminated against when applying to jobs, etc. -- have some success
	- Like the Peace Corps, the Job Corps is focused on economic opportunity -- getting people jobs.
	- 1965 -- Head Start, program for working poor people to get their kids started
- Volunteering
	- Major part -- programs to stimulate volunteering
	- VISTA: Volunteer in Service to America. People volunteering locally to helping people
	- Like a Peace Corps for the inner cities
	- Making people aware of government programs -- many rural poor don't know about new government programs -- a lot of lack of awareness / information about programs people can take advantage of.
	- People worried about taking advantage of government services b/c they'll be stigmatized as lazy, a taker, etc.
	- Johnson is careful to not use terms like 'living on the dole' / welfare
- Health Programs
	- Medicaid and Medicare -- health insurance for hte poor and the elderly
	- Universal Health coverage on the liberal agenda since 1938
	- Government creates the Homeowner's association which redid the mortgage industry by being competitive -- completely remade the mortgage industry and was great for American capitalism and the market system
	- Continued argument over healthcare -- business or a right?
	- Some healthcare companies refer to the people they insure as customers, not necessarily as patients or people
	- Medicaid and Medicare both become part of the gov'm't safety net
- The Arts and Education
	- Programs like the Works Progress administration -- hire artists, songwriters, poets, etc. who would celebrate and reinspire Americans
	- Sesame Street in 1969 and PBS (Public Broadcasting)
	- Public money being made available to promote arts
	- Remain constant targets by those who dont think that the govn'mt should be in the arts
- Successes
	- End of first year of LBJ's presidency, gets 84 / 87 bills submitted to Congress into law by end of 1965 (end of 200 by end of his presidency)
	- A legacy of the Greaet Soceity still remaining, but gets overshadowed by the Vietnam War, massive protests, etc.
	- Creation of Department of Transportation and Housing and Urban Developemnt -- new offices in the cabinet, are also targets
- War on Poverty
	- National poverty rate does decline because of these programs -- 22 to 13 percent nationally over the 60s
	- Become targets for attack
	- Drawbacks
		- All this job training is nice, but manufacturing jobs are disappearing
		- By 65s, economists know that jobs are on their way out -- dindustrialization which happens across the Rust Belt is beginning
		- Middle of 70s, we are deep into a recession, problem of de-industrialization
		- Jobs will not necessarily be there
		- Beginning of rust belt towns
		- Germany and Japan have been rebuilt; other economies which suffered in WWII are being rebuilt; Auto indsutry is being challenged by German and Japanese manufacturing. A lot of automation going on. A lot of jobs were automated out of existence. One hope is that Johnson's tax cut -- capitalists will reinvest in the economy and hire more people. But many of these industries and capitalists invent in automation and further drive the loss of jobs. Cascading effect of job loss.
		- Not a lot of support for unionization. The economics are changing and unions are losing their footing. Not a central piece of the Great Society.
		- Beginning of ascendancy of service jobs -- people are going into service type jobs
- US Indian Policy
	- Parts of American life which got left out -- US Indian Policy
	- Policy of the US federal government swings wildly w.r.t. native people
	- US policy has gone through many different changes
	- 1950s and 60s -- goes through another great upheaval / convulsion of new policy. The very fact that native people / tribes on reservations maintained a tribal status was keeping them down, it was said
	- Government should make native people economically viable and then revoke their special status -- make them like 'everyone else'
	- None of these worked
	- Relocation -- native people were poor bc they were rural; some native people did this and relocated and got jobs, but of course had quite detrimental effects on kinship and tribal comunities.
	- Both policies as well as the boarding school policy are questioned as policy changes again under Nixon, where people can get free tom the country and create hteir own worlds.
- Labor activism
	- We don't see very much about the farmworkers, an ongoing issue
	- INvisible folks  -- many farm workers are quite invisible, come and work in America's fruit fields, pretty much picking all of its fruits
	- Really remains very invisible, live in poor conditions and are paid very small amounts of money for their wages
	- Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta form UFA -- United Farm Workers (1965), go through boycotts and strikes -- reaches far into other states where people start boycotting table grapes because of farmworker conditions
	- Eventually we do see changes in farmworker working condtitions; but left out of consumer society
- Criticisms of the Great Soceity
	- Growing conservative movement -- Buckley's Firing Line TV show
		- Buckley interviews many interesting people
		- w/ Noam Chompsky
		- position w/ James Baldwin (the 'pen drop' speech)
	- Conservative platofrm for drawing attention to the Great Scoeity
	- Goldwater -- criticizes Great Society in 64 while running against LBJ
	- NEA, NEH, PBS remain heavily scrutinized by conservatives
	- Ongoing criticism of the poor
	- Ongoing reliance on the prosperity doctrine (belief system -- if you're successful, it's because you deserve it -- you did the right thing, you did it) and individualism -- one's success is tied to one's goodness, one's failure is tied to one's failures. Dedication to bootstrap mentality

---

## Lecture 9: The Vietnam War in Country (1964 - 1965)
- The Vietnamese have already been fighting for 20 years, and then the US gets involved.
- Argument: A commitment to stop the spread of communism anywhere in the world did not prepare Americans to win a war in this specific place in time
	- The US had devoted itself to a policy of containment
	- Made many many pledges and statements about following this policy and stopping the spread of communism in the world
	- This policy did not prepare the US to step into this particular place and time and be effective
- Getting involved in 64/65
- Kennedy administration begins the process of entry but LBJ definitely follows it up and pours more people into Vietnam, even as he does not want to do any of it. But he feels like he has no choice.
- One hard truth about the US involvement in the Vietnam War
	- Vietnam itself did not matter to America or to Americans, but rather Vietnam was a symbol in the fight against the spread of communism, it mattered a lot
	- LBJ referred to Vietnam as a 'piss-ant little country"
	- Mainly symbolic value -- this simple formula is how the US ends up in a war Americans didn't know, with people Americans didn't understand, with unenviable allies in the Vietnamese south -- nothing promising about getting involved in the war
- Vietnam
	- About the land area of New Mexico -- not very large
	- This amount of land will absorb triple amount of tonnage that was dropped by all countries in WWII -- mostly the south is being bombed
	- 1960 -- almost 32.7 million people; by the end of the war, 3m (8 - 9%) of people die in the portion of the war the US dies in
	- Civil War -- killed about 2% of the American population
	- Hanoi -- big capital, lots of French buildings and cathedrals from the imperial era. After 1954 when the French are defeated, many Catholic Vietnamese go back down to the South with the Communists taking over in the North.
	- End of the river -- Haifong -- large international shipping port. Johnson doesn't want to blow up or mine the harbor and the military leaders want to -- a major source of tension in the war
	- Ho Chi Minh trail -- a road system which runs from the North, goes through Laos, and then goes into the South
	- THe US Navy stops all ships going in and out; naval bloackade 
	- Ho Chi Minh trail willb e the target of enormous bombing campaigns -- the bombs don't do good -- stuff continues to flow South
	- Laos in the Kennedy administration -- agreement between 13-16 countries that Laos would have a neutral government and share power. Painted as if Kennedy gave up and lost it
	- Some people in Vietnam are pushing for Laotian neutrality but US feels like they have to stop them (also the Communists wouldn't have allowed for a neutral government anyway)
	- Cambodia has three factions vying for power -- but also many Communist bases
	- Saigon -- major capital of the South, sits at the delta of the Maikong river delta
	- Da Nang and Hue -- important cities
	- DMZ at the 17th parallel -- not the establishment of different countries -- was a temporary division until the country could come together nad have a vote as a unified nation. Often talked about as North vs. South -- it's more complicated
- Northern Communist Nationalists
	- Ho Chi Minh and Le Duan
	- By 64/65, Ho Chi Minh is being phased out as the US gains interest. Ho Chi Minh is also the only one that the Americans know.
	- Le Duan becomes major policy maker in the North for the Northern communists
	- Two major backers: the USSR and China, play many roles
	- Different angles on what should be happening in Vietnam
	- Soviets -- want to see peaceful coexistence, want to see Northern Vietnamese negotiate so there isn't conflict
	- China -- looking at global revolution, violent if needed, so continuing to stoke the Vietnamese in order to make the revolution possible.
	- Le Duan believes it is an uncompromising position -- the war aims (political goals of war) are to unite Vietnam under a communist government. A fairly exclusive war aim, doesn't allow for many possibilities
- Vietnamese Communists / Nationalists
	- Northern regularly trained conventional forces -- People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) -- trained in the North
	- South: National Liberation Front (NLF) -- trying to convince Southerners who may be on the fence or aligned with the Southern government to come over the Northern side -- or torture / coerce them 
	- NLF gets called the 'Vietcong' or VC derogitorially. You can't tell which side they're on -- they blend in, work in the rice fields at day and subvert at night; these people make the war really hard for Americans, very hard to tell who is the real enemy out in the countryside
	- North -- lots of militias (coastal, scoop out American pilots, etc.) and volunteer civilians -- most of the North is galvanized behind this approach -- a total war approach, all of society is helping to win this war
	- South si massively factionalized, don't have the same kind of cohesion in the south
	- Lots of equipment given to the North by USSR and China
- South Vietnam
	- 1965 -- very tricky map. Many areas in South Vietnam have entrenched NLF sympathies.
	- US doesn't really know what they're getting into -- the US doesn't relaly know the full extent of the war
	- McNamara
	- With the assassination of Ngo Diem in 1963, there are multiple different coups -- differnet generals kicking out and taking over; none of them really got popular support. The US gets behind general Khahn becuae he was young and would do waht the US wanted him to do. By this point the Southern government had no credibility -- people in the South were allied only out of fear. There was very little popular support in the South.
	- Tried to do a new start with Buddhists and the students -- under the Diem regime there is a major crackdown; Khahn tries to make common point. However the Buddhists and students continue to protest throughout this period.
	- Communists on the move -- from 54 to 63, have had a long time to plan, work, infiltrate the South, really get set to try and topple the Southern government
	- Most people are farmers -- people trying to live. both the Southern government and the Communists are trying to politicize people
- The US and its Allies
	- Northern Army -- Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN)
	- Supplied and trained by the US, given a *lot of equipment* -- much of Vietnam War is shipments of American stuff
	- Why is war good? The companies the produce war material is getting shipped into Vietnam
	- By the early seventies, a stream of military goods but also other American consumer products
	- Why is American spending so high? Vietnam War -- what the govenrment is spending so much war on. Vietnam becomes a consumer for American products.
	- ARVN have some problems with corruption -- corruption at the top, corruption on the line -- officers exist who aren't there or don't know what's going on. That being said maybe ARVN troops fought well and with distinction. Performances were far from uniform
	- Major allies in Vietnam -- South Korea, Thailand, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines
		- A lot of South Koreans fought
- Who is the enemy
	- In Vietnam, who is the enemy? Who is being fought?
	- The guys in the unifroms, sure -- but what most Ameircan soldiers were finding when they went into the countryside is that they are facing villages full of people and they can't tell who is a communist and who isn't one
	- The United States and ARVN end up finding a stash of guns or much more rice than one village can consume, make connections, and end up blowing up the village -- dropping bombs, burning things down, etc. -- this makes more enemies
	- Every time they arrest someone and burn a village (US and ARVN), create mor eneemis -- push people further into the camp fo the NLF. Major strategies to get people on our side is something that we are undermining -- gets to become a big problem
- Strategic Hamlet Program -- started by the French and carried over by the AMericans
	- identify Hamlets (little villages) which were targets of the communists and to physically fortify them -- make sure they have enough to eat, brin gin electricity, help them with farming, etc. -- New Deal type, Truman Doctrine -- bring them to our side by helping them. But you can't stand and guard every Hamlet every time -- some of these did work, both for a nationwide program -- all of the South is not viable after a certain time
	- Early on -- a centerpiece to the hearts and minds campaign -- we need to win the hearts and minds of the people
- "Hearts and Minds"
	- Neew Deal, Great Soceity, CORDS -- Civil operations and Rural Development Support
	- Buildin gin new equipment, pesticides, herbicides, more animals, etc. -- as an effort to politicze the Southern people, get them supporting the Southern government. Similar to what the French did. Both sides are putting a lot of pressure -- the US didn't have the time and personnel to do waht the Communists did. The US has a hard time actually politicizing the rural population
- CIA and the Military
	- Some success becuase it replicated what the NLF was going to do: the PHOENIX program (CIA, 1965 - 1972) engaged in the same kind of subserive work -- assassinations, intimidation, identifying who in a village needs to die to get the influence out of that village. PHEONIX program is doing this the entire time -- often there is a lynchpin leader who could drop the Communist influence in an area.
	- Trained ARVN folks to engage in the same kind sof tactics -- investigations, killings, kidnappings, torture, etc.
- War Aims
	- A war aim is a political outcome that you hope to see in the war -- the goals you are fighting for
	- Unlimited and limited wars: your goal is to topple the other government (WWII) vs. anything other than that, respectively
	- Comes out of the Defense Department -- long memorandum of purpose for going to Vietnam (March 10, 1965), Secretary of Defense
		- 70% -- to maintain US reputation -- we staked our reputation on containment
		- 20% -- to check the Chinese, to make sure that they didn't become another patron to a Communist state
		- 10% -- to make life better for people in South Vietnam
		- Have to emerge from crisis without unacceptable taint from methods used (ironic)
	- Getting into it to maintain our reputation  -- lofty goals in the press about saving the South Vietnamese, etc. -- not what is really going on behind the scenes. 
	- A lot of confidence and arrogance going in -- McNamara and Rusk, etc. know this is probably a losing proposition, and they go anyway -- hidden from the American public
	- They're not dummies; it's not that they don't know  -- what explains involvement?
- The Beginning
	- 1964: begins iwth OPlan 34-A, a plan to start to selectively target certain part of the North and to help the ARVN in their ongoing conflict
	- Bombinrg raids on communist bases in Laos -- communists putting bases in laos. Was Johnson going to go into another country and bomb it? (Yes, we will)
	- Commanod raids on bridges, railroads, etc.
	- Use of naval ships to support the South Navy on raids of North Vietnamese coastal isladns, doing surveillance , radio jamming, etc. 
	- Johnson had his advisors draft up something if something happened for Congress
- Gulf of Tonkin Incident (1964)
	- Maddox and Turner Joy -- ships out in the Gulf of Tonkin when North Vietnamese torpedo boats come and attack them -- at first a volley of misses -- the next day, there was a belief that the attacks would resume. The attack never comes, but there is communication between Maddox and Turner Joy that they might have seen a torpedo shot at them; report up the chain of command that they were "probably, but not certainly", attacked
	- Becomes a very controversial issue because it really gets us into the Vietnam War
	- When Johnson is told the Maddox is probably attacked, sends the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution to Congress, and it is almost uninanimously voted for -- no one in the House votes against it, and only two senators vote against it. Time to use force in Vietnam War.
- US Strategy
	- Strategy -- general concept for how to wage war, how to fight a war
	- Tactics -- how troops move around. But strategy is more general.
		1. Support the southern government and the ARVN
			- After 1963, Southern government is unlikely to get support of the people -- the coups and such, and the Communists hammering the populations 
		2. Heart and Minds -- help the Southern government build support among rural populations
			- Too many refuges, Strategic Hamlet abandoned
			- Many people caught in the middle
		3. Bomb the North until they agree to negotiate -- break morale
			- US sees that its tech superiority will just lay waste to whatever it wants; the North can't sustain American bombing
			- Bombing created massive criticism of the US; they were globally condemened, entirely abandons the anti-war movement in the US, and it never broke the moral of the north
		4. Naval blockades, river patrols; attempts to render the terrain unusuable
			- The Ho Chi Minh Trail always stayed open despite the bombings
			- THe NLF build large systems of underground tunnels
		5. Destroy communist guerillas in the South through decisive action
			- Guerrillas ate away at American morale by inflicting massive physical and pyschological wounds -- got very good at sniping, ambush, etc. which chipped away at American morale
	- All facing real challenges going into the war.
- The US was engaging in a war knowing that it was going to be very difficult -- throwing their weight behind a revolving door of generals. The South did not trust their government. ARVN, burning rice and villages -- imprisoning suspected Communists. Both hearts and minds and punishing the countryside. (which works against the US). Bombing the North -- main target is morale, bringing the North to the negotiating table. But it just doesn't work. The bombing campaigns don't break the morale. The Ho Chi Minh trail stays open; guerrillas in the South build underground tunnels.
- PAVN and NLF strategy
	- Undercut the 'puppet' government in the South -- in the North, strategy is to undermine this government and have pretty much done this by 1967, there is no real legitimacy to the government by then.
	- Persuade, intimidate, threaten, etc. southerners to join forces or at least to disavow the southern government. Undermining support for the government. This was largely successful already by 1965. The Vietnamese communists had been fighting since the mid-40s
	- Erode American morale. Americans helped with this -- in essence both sides targeted the other side's morale and both thought they would be capable of doing so.
	- Demonstrate resolve to maintain foreign support, especially from China (the most significant supporter)
- Two different sets of strategies. 
- THe fear for Johnson mainly is China, which is the lynchpin for how they run the war how they do -- if we hit them too hard, China may enter the war like in Korea and we've given ourselves a bigger enemy -- Johnson is thinking about how to punish the north so far they are brought to the negotiating table without briging in China.
- Operation Rolling Thunder
	- Beginning of the bombing, went on for quite a long time.
	- Not just big B-52 bombers unleashing thousands of tons of bombs, but also smaller aircraft and helicopters trying to declare the Ho Chi Minh Trail -- bombed the fuck out of the Ho Chi Minh Trail
	- Dropped various munitions including napalm, 250 lb bombs ('snake')
	- Napalm, developed during WWII, mix of jelly and gasoline, when it explodes it throws sticky fire on everything and it burns. Napalm explosions are a common usage
	- Very controversial -- throughout the war -- done under the idea of graduated escalation. McNamara (sec of defense) on how to get the North to come to the negotiating table. Turn up the bounding to a high volume, then turn the volume down and hope they come down to negotiate. Very optimistic outlook on American technological capabilities. The US generals hated this -- did we tie one hand behind our back, the politicians screwed up the war because they didn't let the US military unleash its full power and beat the enemy in submission, doing the turn up and turn down screwing around. US generals are going apeshit over the McNamara policy.
	- This policy was followed by the DoD throughout the war. BY 1965 already 180 US aircraft are lost over Vietnam and Laos because they had good anti-aircraft surface-to-air missiles.
	- 1964, first US pilot shot down, stayed a prisoner of war the entire war
	- Building up large numbers of American PoWs held in prison camps throughout the war
- Ho Chi Minh Trail becomes a bombing target
	- In Laos because they hoped that being in Laos they would avoid some of the bombing, since Johnson promised not expanding the war; but the US drops it anyway. However the North had so many volunteers and civilians that theyw ould re-open the Ho Chi Minh trail overnight, massive numbers of people who worked just on the trail with basic equipment.
	- For the US, the question about the 'boots on the ground' -- put actual soldiers into Vietnam?
- Johnson's "War of restraint"
	- How is Johnson going to keep the Vietnam War politically viable? Says in 1964 that he is aware he doesn't have mothers on his side -- many people not happy about boots on the ground. Many young American men will volunteer early on because they have the patriotic spirit, but Johnson feels that he is walking a very thin line w.r.t. the public. "One of the most restrained military actions in world history" -- of course will drop insane numbers of bombs. Hardly a war on restraint.
	- Some off-limits targets: main harbor Haiphong Harbor, the US military generals cannot believe the US is not mining the harbor, want to shut off all trade. Also central Hanoi
- Lesson of WWII in terms of air power: people come out of WWII believing that it worked bc it was so technological sophisticated and that it was so impressive -- massive bombing runs. Analysis by most historians is that air power at best had mixed results. The Germans were bombed heavily, but the Germans are still pumping out a numbe rof important products which let them wage war. Loss of life on the ground, questionable at best. We however still rely on airpower to win the Vietnam War. Unclear why they thought that the air approach would work; it had not shown to be decisive. 
- 1965: Da Nang is a big city in the Northern part of the Southern part of Vietnam. This is where the US marines are mostly, in I Corps (4 major core operations)
	- WHen the marines land, they didn't even tell the southern government that they wer coming --- this is the sort of relationship that the US has with the southern government now.
	- Pretty clear that the US begins taking over major military operations as soon as it gets enough people.
	- Gen. Maxwell Taylor is the ambassador to South Vietnam, has very Hawkish policy.
	- New guy in charge of the war: Gen. Wm. Westmoreland. In WWII. Was an impressivec ommanding general. When the film Hearts and Minds is made, his comment in 1974 looking back is "the oriental does not value life as we do", the guy in chargeof running the war. Westmoreland is responsible for misleading the AMericna public beginning from the beginning of the war until 1968, when the bottom falls out of the whole thing. A main agent of telling Americans repeatedly that we are going to win soon, 'light at the end of the tunnel' -- a few more 100k troops and everything will be cleaned up. In 1968 when the Tet Offensive happens, people recoil: we thought the war was over, this is when American support totally bottoms out. Westmoreland set up a lot of this. These people know that what they are saying is not true -- try to maintain morale but ultimately undermining it. Reports which are totally false about the amount of troops on the Northern side that the Americans are killing. Trying to enact a self-fulfilling prophecy. Turns a number of south Vietnamese people against the Americnas. Beginning to see the Americans as French 2.0 in the South, many in the South who begin to question US involvement.
	- First bombing runs in 1964 after the Gulf of Tonkin institution
	- Ground troops are being told lies; and they know that these are lies -- people on the ground know that the war is being reported in a misleading way.
- Boots on the ground
	- It would take decisive American power to force the North Vietnamese to give up
	- McNamara has to think about the political ramifications -- 1k deaths a month, 600k troops -- with the strategy of graduated escalation and Johnson's war of restraint. Something which is very hard for the politicians to follow -- a heavy debt to pay. Come up with this idea of body count. We need to be killing more of the enemy than they kill of us. Questions about misalignment between the political and the military leadership. Not fighting to win. Trying to support the Southern government and giving them legitimacy, although this idea is pretty out of the window.
- 1965, politicians are telling one story behind the scenes and telling the Americna public a different story. Have intense doubts about what is to come, although tey express it in different ways, know that they aren't going to get a lot of support in the South. Know that the Americans will object to the deaths. What they take advantage of in the beginning as that Americans are extremely patriotic and that the generation after WWII will be patriotic and stand behind the government, riding hard that Americans trust their government to do the right thing. It is a level of trust that, when broken, will not be easily put back together.
- A lot of advisors with few exceptions are advising Kennedy that the only way to be politically viable (and Johnson) is to stay strong in the US.
- Goldwater known for saying extreme things

Part 2, the War.
- Early campaigns the US uses -- (corresponds to post-war American consumerism): operation RANCH HAND, involves the spraying of large amounts of herbicides to kill the cover of the forest so they can see enemy movements; it is a triple canopy forest and very hard to see through. Idea is to defoliate as much of the forestry (IN THE SOUTH) as possible.
- Aerila herbicides
	- Large areas of III-corps from 1961 to 1971, out there spraying and killing large amounts of tree cover in the southern part of Vietnam.
	- Go by the names of the colors painted on the outside of the drums, agent Orange, Blue, Pink, ... made by Monsanto, Dow Chemical, etc... contains some of the most toxic stuff there is
	- Spraying these chemicals over everyone -- US soldiers and Vietnamese civilians develop very serious health issues. Villagers become beginning refugees; farm areas are being sprayed with chemicals, makes the Hearts and Minds campaing even more difficult.
	- Vietnam goes from being a rice exporter to a rice importer
- Helicopters and tactics
	- Major technolgoical innovation which starts in Korea becomes a major workhorse of the American campaign.
	- Helicopters became necessary for everything because of the terrain -- they needed helicopter airlifts in many places.
	- Marines used the Sikorsky helicopter
	- "Huey" helicopters made by Bell Helicopter (did pretty well during the war)
	- Gave a lot to the ARVN and trained their pilots to use Huey helicopters
- November 1965, Ia Drang campaign	
	- Part of a 43-days campaign, really revolves around two significant battles
	- *We Were Soldiers Once and Young*
	- Small number of US troops involved, 1k, ferried in by helicopter, ferrying in a small number at a time and dropping them off in these landing zones
	- Idea is that they locate where a large number of enemy troops are (2500, 3000 troops by a massive mountain), draw out the enemy troops engaging the ground truths, then pound them with artillery and air support. Main thrust of what the US army is doing -- search and destroy missions. First calvary division -- engage in the battle.
	- 3-day battle of Ia Drang valley, only wayt o survive by constatly calling in air strikes and artillery
	- Americans are basicallys urrounded -- suffer such surrounded casualities (including napalm accidentally falling on the US soldiers, burning to death) -- calling in 'broken arrow' --- a US outfit is being totally taken out, calls in every airplane to start bombing the enemy to rescue the American troops.
	- Seen as a tactical victory at X-ray
	- Are ambushed by another communist group on their way to LZ Albany, 50% casualties -- LZ-Xray 44% casualty rate, extreme in terms of casualty rates
	- Devastating losses at the IA Drang valley.
	- Both sides learned lessons.
		- US: our tactics work. Artillery and air support are so devastating that it works. Find the enmy and beat them with your technological advantages. It's the thing they will keep going.
		- North: when you fight Americans, you have to draw them by the belt buckle -- you have to get close enough so that they can't just bomb you -- the tactics totally change, settle into tactics of sniping, hit and run missions, booby traps, etc.
		- After 1965, American soldiers report contact -- engagements last maybe 2 minutes or 15 minutes at most -- get hit, lose a few guys, and disappear -- a major tactic for the Communist forces and a significant eroding of American morale. 
- US -- 1965, a battle of attrition -- body counts, a problematic objective. In most wars you don't want to start with a war of attrition -- both sides get beat up, just hope you beat the other side worse. Strategy froma ttrition is problematic to begin from the beginning; one can understand it when you consdier the US technological superiority, but it is not a winning strategy.
	- By 1965, over 200k troops in the counry
	- PAVN/PLAF strategy of guerilla warfare begins to show more sucess
- American society at war
	- American society is gearing up towards war, the beginning of the teach-ins
	- Tech-ins begin at University of Michigan before spreading to more than 100 campuses, mainly faculty trying to talk about the war and students trying to understand it.
	- Begin in 1965, reflecting the sit-ins and wade-ins; students come in and listen to faculty speaking about the war
	- Teach-ins, generlly an anti-war feeling; also start generating counter-protests -- when there is an anti-war protest, there is also a counter-protest
- The Draft
	- Beginning of conscription
	- Conscription has been talked about as the most direct way that the state can coerce you into doing its bidding
	- The draft is a complicated issue; has been used initially to stimulate volunteering -- if you choose where you go into the military you can choose; otherwise you go where they say. More people volunteer with the announcement of the draft to not end up in the infantry.
	- 1964, 112k 
	- Handled by local draft boards working as part of the federal government's draft; you would meet a veteran from WWII or Korea, they would evaluate you for service and you would come out with a designation. 1A -- going into the military. 2S -- student and can have a deferment. 4H -- still in high school. 4F -- mental, physical, or a moral disability which keeps you out of the military.
	- After 1969, because this is seen s an unfair system, it becomes a lottery ystem based on your birthdate. September 14th, first one drew -- if your birthday was drawn, everyone with that birthday is put into the service.
	- 1/2 volunteers, 1/2 draftees -- many of the drafted were placed into the infantry, made up of 80% of the casualties
	- Serious aracual components -- the poor (always do the fighting), the rural, and the Black -- a disrpoportionate number of the drafted and the wounded + infantry
	- Civil Rights leaders did complain about this and got it worked up, but 11% of the population and 17% of the draftees and 31% of the infantry in 1965.
	- Middle class puts up a lot of people into the service, about a third of draftees come out of the middle class
	- By 1967, 467k troops in Vietnam; 11.1k kileld in action
- Sum up -- getting into a war that leaders did not want introduced a new crisis into an already rapidly changing society. a democratic society already undergoing greater experientation with liberalism begins to question its own government about war.
- Early on, many patriots volunteering -- trust the government, many volunteering and even the drafted go -- of course later we run into different problems post -68; the amount of drug use and disciplinary problems goes up hugely (fragging), illegal killings, etc. But the early years should not be tainted by how they end.

## Lecture 10: The Rise of Black Power

Rough Draft
- 4 to 6 pages developing some of the sources for how they are being used
- Not supposed to be the entire project done

Lecture
- Argument: Though not a well-defined or unified movement, Black Power gave voice to many Black Americans who promoted Black pride and connections to Africa, as well as demanded immediate institutional changes.
- Mainstream Civil Rights movements accomplishes many civil rights legislation -- the other part on changing attitudes and behaviors still needs to be done. Black and white students alike began to work towards those kinds of changes, but met with significant resistance
- Black Power is not particularly well defined. Not particularly a singular unified movement though.
- A new kind of pride that comes with the association with the continent of Africa as opposed to a previous sense of embarrassment. 

Origins of Black Power
- Origins of Black Power from changes towards integration and other attempt sto get voting, civil rights.
- Malcolm X sees the nonviolent approach as a shameful one -- one that played into the hands of white oppression
	- Blacks should forcefully resist
- One origin: seeing the violence done to black folks in America by the police and vigilantes

Black Militancy
- Early Black militant, forefather of the Black Power/Militancy movement: Robert F. Williams
- *Negroes with Guns* (1962) -- advocated Blacks arming themselves
- Engaging with the question of black militancy and power
- Exiled to Cuba, sets up a radio -- Radio Free Dixie, 1961 to 1965. Is a platform for ideas about Blacks arming themselves, Black militancy, etc. Not just hearing the SNCC or SCLC line of non-violence

Black Militancy
- Malcolm X -- joins Nation of Islam, important connections to Africa, sees Islam as an important part of this
- Christianity in America as a white religion; black people who have taken it are getting a white version of this religion and can never really get out from under white control
- Islam is seen as having a stronger connection to black folks in Africa
- Talks a lot about ideas of pride and self-discipline that Malcolm felt that many black people were missing
- Becomes disillusioned with Elijah Muhammad on the idea of setting forwards a black capitol or black state; feels that Muhammad talked a lot about it but it didn't materialize; however this vision for economic independence was a centerpiece
- A strong critique of integration -- how to integrate and be treated equally is a key concern of King but Malcolm X is strongly critical of it
- Mainstream Civil Rights movement and Nation of Islam did not see eye to eye
	- Most people saw the NoI as a radical organization

James Meredith's March Against Fear
- Decides on his own without organizational support to do a march from Tennessee into Jackson, Mississippi -- the march against fear. As a free man in America, should be able to walk through America
- Was shot by a white supremacist
- Leaders of SNCC, SCLC< CORE picked up the march into Jackson, Mississippi, demonstrating that James Meredith's desire to operate as a free man in America would not be silenced
	- Stokley Carmichael, King, ...
	- Many people put the origin of the term 'black power' here -- Stokley Carmichael picks it up and uses it in speeches

Rejection of Interracialism
- Changes going on are beginning to fracture the left, very broadly
- Rejection of interracialism within the black power movement and organizations dedicated to Civil Rights
- CORE and SNCC both had mixed whit eand black leadership in them, but organizations are beginning to change around 1967
- John Lewis ran against Stokely Carmichael to lead one of the SNCC chapters; Lewis is mainstream Civil Rights whereas Carmichael is becomming someone who articulates Black Power. Carmichael wins and brings a new black power significance into SNCC etc. 
- Begin purging organizations of white leadership as Malcolm X etc. had that suggested that whites in organizations would begin to take over eventually, and that whites couldn't truly understand the conditions that black people were talking about, and that therefore they had nor ole to play in the leadership of these organizations
- Increasingly organizations became more black-led and less interracial

Black Power
- Stokley Carmichael becomes one of the voices for the SNCC in 1966
- lots of criticisms of violence against blacks in America and especially against civil rights demonstators who were attacked
- Talked a lot about the failure of politicans to address many of the problems which plagued black people in america, including the condition of urban ghettos
- Becomes the voice for these sorts of organizations
- Another change -- generational divide which is beginning to emerge.
- Older folks (e.g. Fannie Lou Hamer, famous in 1964 as part of the Mississippi Freedom Party which treid to get seated at the 1964 Democratic convention) are fading whereas younger folks who are more willing to say radical things openly about oppression and not using more toned-down language become more popular
- Generational divide emerges (generations of activism)
- Stokley begins taking trips abroad and find a shock of how worse it is for black people in America as opposed to in Europe. 
- White liberals are retreating from SNCC

Black Panther Party for Self-Defense
- 1966, Oakland, California -- the Black Panther party
- Bobby Seale, Huey P. Newton
- "Freedom by any means necessary"
- Expression of Black power. Are thinking in terms of black independence movements, linking this with revolutionary struggles going on in the world, including anti-colonial struggles in southeast asia and africa. See Balck Americans as a kind of legacy of colonialism -- still a group which has been colonized
- Originaly name is Black Panther Party for Self-defense -- see themselves as defending themselves from white drug dealers, white men coming to look for sex workers, cops coming into neighborhoods and harrassing them, etc.
- Focus a lot on neighborhoods and programs in these neighborhoods
- Seattle -- focus on Central District. Once the Black Panther party formed in Seattle, formed a lot of neighborhood programs
- Free Breakfast Program -- helping people in their neighborhood who needed it
- Oakland 1966 and Seattle becomes the next place where there is a Black Panther Party
- A central part of this is guns and militancy -- a lot of the people in the BPP come out of the military, some out of the Vietnam War -- have no qualms holding guns. Houses in the Central District loaded with guns -- were always armed to the teeth, ready for shootouts. Were regularly harrassed by the police
- Leather jackets, black tams, militant look and stance -- central to what they were about. Self-defense as a central part of what they are doing.
- Viewed by most white Americans as a dangerous group
- Seattle
	- Aaron, Elmer, and Michael Dixon
	- Aaron Dixon remains politically active and was a candidate for many third parties in Seattle
	- Many programs are specifically resisting white intrusions into the central district

Black is Beautiful
- Embracing of blackness which had not been possible in the same way before
- Angela Davis, Nina Simone, others
- Begin to embrace Blackness
- The Afro becomes a major symbol of this -- growing hair long rather than conforming to an ideal of what it should be
- Angela Davis -- interesting figure, highly educated person who identifies as a c ommunist and does not apologize for political and social views. Becomes a sort of intellectual lightning rod during this time. Will continue to be this way throughout the 1970s and recent times
	- Brings up intersectionality
- Nina Simone -- wanted to be the first black woman to play piano at Carnegie Hall as a young woman, but discovered she has a great distinctive voice. late 50s, had to look like a typical vocalist -- dolled up. Goes through a transformation and comes out with a novel persona
- A lot of this has to do with connections to Africa and celebrations of Black heritage

Black is Marketable
- True of hippieism and more -- the way in which the capitalist marketplace is very flexible
- The moment that advertisers begin to catch onto black is beautiful, move to embrace and envelop it to sell products
- Middle of 1960s, especially after 66 -- obvious sort of play into the black power movement.

Celebrating Blackness and Africanness
- Certain centers become the most important -- e.g. Harlem in New York, places in Chicago, etc.
- Jimi Hendrix -- a sort of 'black hippie' -- hippies usually seen as middle class white kids, but Hendrix has this quality of embracing hipppie lifestyle and clothing but fused it with black pride aesthetic as well, moving between these different groups.
- Dr. Maulana Karenga, started the celebration of Kwanza, a kind of African holiday being celebrated
- Black Arts Movement (1965), celebrating art forms of Africa

Christianity and Black Power
- Christianity had been central to black experience for a long time, comes out of a deep past in American evangelicalism and the South. Some continued to double down on this connection with christianity
- Rev. James Hal Cone writes the 1967 *Black Theology and Black Power*
- Focuses on the liberating elemenets of Christianity
- "LIberation theology" 
- WHat is happening to the Catholic Church in the early part of the sixties? Catholic Church -- Christianity should be used to help the marginaized and poor of the world, to uplift black folks
- Throughout the sixties, more reliacne on aesthetics

Fred Hampton and the Intelligence State
- Certain parts of the Black Power movement are extremely frightening to white america
- You get a backlash, become targets of police organizations, FBI, and CIA, which is not even supposed to be doing stuff within American border
- Infiltrate organizations and get people to say that they are communists or did drugs, etc. -- building files so that the FBI could prosecute the
- Classic counterintelligence stuff -- publicze people in a negative light, try to get them ruined in the pulic eye
- Fred Hampton becomes a central figure, singled out and important. Inspired by communist influences
- Did a lot of work with youth.
- FBI sprays the place with sozens of bullets and murder Fred Hampton and Mark ...

In Sum
- By 1970, Black Power has left its mark on activism, local politics, community action, aesthetics, film, movie, art, and wareness of police violence.
- Ongoing attempts to achieve these goasl in the following decades.

## Lecture 11: New Left, New Right
Argument: The dissatisfaction with post-war America had both left and right lening criticisms. Whereas the New Left's dedication to liberation meant that it fractured by 1967, the new conservatives found greater coherence and longevity in its critique of the left, which comes to set the tone for what we see in the following decades.
- This is part of the nature of being on the left
- Being on the left means there are a number of voices, embraces of diversity of voices and issues and so on, and that the nature of liberation is to begin to break down boundaries
- Being on the left can mean a sprawl of interests and ideas. 
- Liberation comes out of the black freedom struggle and inspires many other groups to also push for liberalism, which causes the New Left to become much more atomized than the right, which coheres
- The Right is just beginning to articulate their main ideas. You see them really come together and put fine points on what makes post-WII conservatism what it is.
- The New Left -- anyone who wanted to see liberation for themselves as an individual added to the aspect of the New left coming apart -- race, sex and gender, anti-war, class, etc.

The Old Left
- Inspired by the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, other kinds of fringe leftist parties and movements on the far left
- IWW, Industrial Workers of the World (1910s)
- 1930s, Black Americans gravitated towards the Communist Party because it was the only group doing anything about race in the 1930s
- Often articulated challenges to the capitalist system
- Employing industrial workers in the early part of the 20th century
- Compromise is New Deal liberalism -- groups on the left inspire, like the New Deal liberals in the FDR admin who are definitely communist socialist inspired

Folk Movement
- Often articulated in the folk movement of the 1960sd
- Woody Guthrie, "This Land is Your Land" -- coming from this sort of socialist inspiration

Decline of the Old left
- The Cold War and anti-communism after WWII kills off emphasis from the fringe left
- After groups like HUAC (House on Unamerican Activities Committee) and McCarthyite witch trials forces the left in America to begin to purge connections with communists and socialists
- Bad examples -- Stalin's repressive regime until 1953 death, 15m to 50m killed; Mao's Great Leap Forward and the worst famine, 20m people killed. Examines of far-left regimes, don't look great. The left begins dumping these connections.
- Castro in Cuba after the Bay of Pigs invasion
- Comes from the rise inc ollege students. By 1968, over 7 million students in US -- largest number of college students in the sixties in american history, and it is these students who begins articulating the New Left

The New Left
- Comments on the problems of the American capitalist society
- Draw a lot of inspiration, maybe even the most, from SNCC, CORE, etc. Students demand participatory democracy -- not really willing to wait for politicans to do something, want to go out and do it themselves
- Another target is militarism; becomes a big part of the anti-war movement. 
- Brings in a variety of different left-leaning politics into the US -- government programs, volunteer programs, etc. Leave behind a lot of the fringe communist conenctions.
- New Left makes up a lot of different people: mainstream Democratcs, but also real radicals, liberals, activists, scholars, students, people who want to see change
- Spontaneous and decentralized
- Activism, not waiting for bureaucratic processes
- SDS not in control of everything -- anti-racism, anti-war protests often pop up spontaneously

The Origins of the New Left
- Inspired mainly by what young, Black activists are doing in the South.
- A lot of activism comes from this origin point.
- Pointing out how American values do not match American realities. Talk about the long history of abolition and the way in which Americans talk about freedom but stil have a connection to history
- Drawing upon previous academic work to critique consumer culture and business culture -- does not speak to goals and ideals, want something different
- Black freedom movement and inter-racialism is an important part of this: people in the New left join into groups like CORE and SNCC, believe in interracial leadership
- Inspired by the Frankfurt School of social theory, critical theory: discourse on modernism, post-modernism, capitalism, etc. 

University of California, Berkeley
- Free Speech Movement in UCB 1964-1965
- The University had shut ddown any sort of political activism and talk around the student body relating to the Vietnam War just as the Gulf of Tonkin resolution had just been passed
- Students were told they were part of the 'knowledge industry' -- many took offense to this, students in college to figrue out what they wanted to do and be and administrations making them sound like cogs in a machine. 
- Students at Berkeley turn against this idea that the university is in a way not on their side
- Free Speech Movement in Berkeley -- "Don't trust anyone over thirty" but also receive help from the faculty who end up breaking the stalemate, teach-ins

Essence of the Sixties
- A lot of middle class white folks mixed with the most disempowered in American society wh o make the argument that only structural change and direct involvement can improve society
- Less waiting for Kennedy to announce let's try to change things and more of grassroots movements, political involvement, become ungovernable, people will listen because we have to

Civil Rights and the New Left
- CR becomes jumping off point for the New Left, which begins to embrace Civil Rights tactics and issues

Being on the Left
- Sit-in at the U of Michigan, one of the first places
- Many of these things are happenin gin Michigan due to connection with the UAW -- important inspiration for student activism, important labor-student relation
- A lto of protests -- workers and students protesting similar problems
- Connections to the Civil Rights movement, offering critique nad satire of American society and communism
- Characteristics and behaviors begin to be more common in this group in the new left
- More libertine, less attached to older notions of sexual propriety, less worry about tradition and clothing and body regulation (biopolitics), part of bieng young and on the old left *in certain areas* on the coasts and in college towns. Not too widespread.
- Based in academics, interested in reading sociological, critical, political theory
- Common declarations of isolation and alienation -- American society does not speak to them
- A lot of middle class youth are an important element here, as well as in hippies
- Psychologist Kenneth Keniston: sixties youth rebellion "characteritistically consisted in using against the parents the parents' own principles" -- borrowing from and resisting the previous generation. Coming out of liberal families, go out in the streets and raise their voices, a enw activist generation

March on Washington, 1965
- There had been protests against Dow CHemical which drew very few people
- 1965 March on Washington drew over 20k people to protest the Vietnam War. 
- This is stil when most Americans would not have turned towards resistance
- SDS and Robert Moses, SNCC
- Repeated concern -- why spending so much time and money in Vietnam given the domestic issues -- a recurring refrain

Changes to the New Left
- After 65, 66 and 67 are the 'high points' of the sixties
- 68, the whole world begins coming apart
- 66 and 67 are high water marks of awareness and activism, hopefulness for change, awareness that we can live different lives
- SDS begins to change becuase it moves out of the main college campuses and also into other small places
- Less dedicated to the intellectual foundations they came from and just more radical and interested in disruption, the basis for intellectual foundations isn't as much there
- Begins going after colleges because colleges provide draft boards with rankings -- if you fall below a certain ranking, you get drafted. SDS started going after the colleges and making a big stink about how the colleges were putting themselves in the middle of the Vietnam War.
- Leaving behind the universities because of its ties to the interests of corporate and military elite
	- Universities are complicit in training students to work for corporations, increasingly making this connection to anti-war protests
- Women in SDS and other parts of the New Left are identifying that what began with Black liberation and now general social liberation still treats women as if they are secondary. Women will move out of SDS and increasingly infuse the Women's Liberation Movement

Anti-war, Anti-imperialism
- The New Left had begin to change, a growing sense of desperation
- As early as 65 there are people demanding an immediate end to the war or at least the bombing, and it wasn't happening
- What began as an anti-war protest became anti-imperialism -- you will see anti-war protests holding signs attributing American war to imperialism
- Shocking to middle America -- a jarring sort of experience, but here we can see how frustration is growing

Ramparts Magazine
- A radical publication out of California
- More calls for overthrowing capitalism
- Protesters begin to carry Viet Cong flags at anti-war protests, which absolutely enrages middle-Americans, who think of their children being murdered by the Viet Cong
- Becoming intensely critical; protests are trying to garner attention

The emergence of an Alternate Right
- More coherent and consistent -- cohering around specific ideas
- Two basic pillars of what the right coheres around
	1. The government has no role to play in the market system
		- The free market syste only works when it is unregulated and when capitalists and corporations are able to function withotu the impositions of government
		- A direct shot at the New Deal, the Great Soceity, the welfare state, etc.
	2. Need for a central morality based in traditional religion
		- Religious ecunemelcualism -- many Jewish intellectuals are part of the formation of the new right -- the fundamentals don't matter; what matters is a breakdown in American morality and a need to return to old-time religious traditions

Post-1945 Conservatism: Economics
- Milton Friedman -- famous face of the conservative school of thought -- great advances never come from centralized government (1962). 
- Suggesting that the government needs to be pulled out of regulation
- Friedrich von Hayek
- Only a free market allows for a free soceity to exist
- A sort of linkage being made here which is far-fetched but the beginning of thinking about the left as not that far from what the Nazis did in Europe or what Stalin did in the Soviet Union
- Sociologist Robert Nisbet -- the state gets in the way of natural divisions between people, which are argued on the other side as social constructions
- If you can make it natural, then you can begin to entice people on what youa re talking about

Post-1945 Conservatism: Culture
- *Protestant Catholic Jew* -- a need for a strict moral code in American life
- 1953, *The Conservative Mind* -- convention are checks on anarchic impulse, lust for power
- Trying to introduce morality into American life
- Point to 62-63 when the SC rules that states cannot require prayer in school as part of separation of church and state
- A sense of embracing fundamentals because they are being lost; liberals are taking down conventional morality

John Birch Society (1958)
- Intensely anticommunist
- Important fringe on the right starting in the late 50s
- Won't grow to have that many members, 100k at its height in 1963, a lot in the south and through the sun belt
- Far-right-wing group which as at its core intensely anticommunist and deeply evangelical-Christian
- Promoted some really wild conspiracy theories about America and liberals in particular
- JBS said that Eisenhower had seriously been a communist and other sorts of far-right ideas
- Some conservatives worried that JBS was too nutty, but many embraced what JBS was able to do
- Do a good job nevertheless pushing the tenor of the conversation further to the right by making spurious associations
- Segregationist, anti-liberal, anti-communist platform
- Orange County, California -- ~40 chapters of the John Birch society
- Heavy presence in the sun belt -- California, Arizona, etc.

Popular Conservatives
- Conservatives feel an anxiety about poor representation in media
- Jojhn Wayne, *The Alamo* (1960) -- conservatism behind the Alama fighting the liberals (the Mexican Army) -- stand your ground against onslaught
- Ronald Reagan
- Pat Roberson, the *700 Club*

William F. Buckley Jr.
- The *National Review* -- publishing religious ecumenicalism, anticommunism -- articulating a new right position
- The *Firing Line*
- Has many folks on, fairly entertaining and interesting -- a time in which civility was respected
- Earlier in carrier, sticked to a strong segregationist and racist stance, although steps sideways in the late sixties
	- Blacks should not vote b/c not 'as far up the civilization as whites'
- Universal suffrage is a liberal trick
- Naturalizing ideas about race -- God, nature, etc.

Young Americans for Freedom
- Support Goldwater in 1964
- Supporters of William Buckley and Ronald Reagan
- Believe in the idea of the free market and its connections to persaonl freedom, limited government
- Become a kind of insurgency in the Republican Party, moving it in the way that they want it to go -- departing from the Eisenhower tradition. Getting more politically active.
- By 1962, 175 chapters and 20k members, enough to shape policies in some places

Origins of the current conservative/liberal divide
- Irving Kristol, Daniel Bell (important), Daniel Patrick Moynihan
- All guys who were part of the left but now in the 1960s in the time of prosperity, feel that the government should recede into the background and become the neocon intellectuals.
- *The real cold war has begun* -- Irving Kristol
- "Cultural wars"
- Liberals identified as a main threat to the world
- A number of gains in 1966 -- won many seats in conference after Johnson had done pretty well in 64 and 65 in Great Society Legislation, but is very difficult later on
- Reagan is governor of California and moves UC system from taxes towards tuition based college system
- The right saw the left as much more unified than it was
- Formation of a coagulating coherent whole
- Many future influential conservatives get their start in this cohering conservative ideology.

Sum Up

The New Left and the emergent right helped to redefine politics for the 
coming decades though as the New Left fractured into many liberation 
movements, the Right cohered around key issues and tactics.

## Lecture 12: Counterculture, Subculutre, and Dropping Out
The counterculture: if it can be talked about in the singular, had shifted from critique of the mass society to expressions of personal liberation. By breaking through the limits of American society, young people especially explored alternative lifestyles and limits of their own personal freedom.

## Lecture 13: Vietnam War -- 1966 - 1967
as the criticism of the war expanded across US society and government, the political and military leaders misled the American people and deepened US involvement in the war. However the militarya nd government were superficially dedicated to the war, the ways that they prosecuted the war undercut soldiers' morale and civilian support

- The way that they are talking about the end of the war undercuts how they manage the war -- Americans aren't seeing the results
- Antiwar protests go up
- By 1967 there are massive anti-war protests instead of the smaller ones which came earlier

The Jungle
- The idea of a jungle is so central to the narrative dimension of the Vietnam War 
- "Fighting in a Jungle"
- Environmental history
- A jungle is not a real palce -- there is no biophysical characteristic in which a 'jungle' exists
- A jungle is in your mind -- it's an idea which was created about certain types of forests
- A forest is a biophysical place -- dominated by trees
- Idea comes from the moment where UEropeans come to the tropical places of the world -- Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Americas
- Alexander von Humboldt -- popularizes what's going on in the tropics to Europeans
- Europeans are fascinated by plants from other places -- 
- Considerations on the agriculture of the 'torrid zone' (tropics) -- land cleared $$\to$$ the progress of society
- Fertility of the natural world allows for 'lack of civility' -- connection between fertile places int he world with lots of heat and rain that grow lots of stuff produce backwards, lazy civilizations
- The jungle is where these places are at -- a way of racializing space -- the 'torrid zone', hot and humid
	- Full of difficulties -- tribulation, dangerous animals, insects, diseases, etc.
	- This place is the jungle
	- What is 'overgrown'? The idea of an overgrown place is the contstruct of the European fantasy -- a forest which confuses and frightens Europeans -- not an 'actual' space
	- An 'urban jungle', 'jungle fever', 'jungle story'
	- The Vietnam War was fought in jungles
- Tropicality
	- Dual vision of the tropics that supports imperialism and racism
	- Lush, overgrown, productive environments produce lazy, unproductive peoples

Fighting the Ground War 
- Enemy contact in point-blank range -- emphasizes the danger of the place, can't see very hard -- a difficult environment to fight in
- Nguyen Cao Ky -- US ally in 1966, but also a man who said that what Vietnam needed was five Hitlers. Had strong opinions about what Vietnam should look like.
- General Nguyen Van Thieu -- trying to fight with Ky. US got right in the middle of it -- tired of the rotating wheel of generals  -- Ky becoms the vice president and Thieu the president
- Ongoing problems in South Vietnam -- many student protests, Budhists not achieving civil rights they had hoped for
- protests against the US presence (1965 boots on the ground arrival)
- South Vietnamese, many not happy about these -- US taking over ground operations on their own and leaving the ARVN behind 
- Many protests in SV against the US presence
- In Saigon, air attacks would be unleashed on their own people 
- American soldiers are thinking about what they are doing in Vietnam

MACV-USAID -- Pacification
- Strateigc hamlet program was not working in general
- Pacification -- trying to get rural people on their side is not generally working, too many communists in the south
- Too many abuses by the SV government -- southern peasants and farmers are neutral or say yes to whoever shows up, stuck in a middle situation
- Villagers are caught in the middle -- emergence of 'free fire zones', places where you can legally kill anyone 
- Villages or a certain area of mountains or the forests have been designated so dangerous that anyone out there must be the enemy
- A lot of tactics are undermining the government's attempt to prosecute the war

Rolling Thunder
- Bombing continues -- B-52 bombing
- Time to time Johnson will call it off and try to negotiate or the criticism reaches a pitch, but bombing resumes
- McNumara is getting more information that this is not helping
- Many countries are criticizing the US, although the US says publicly that they are winning the war
- New attacks on oil fields; the NV build underground tanks and get new oil shipments from China, USSR
- Generals are saying let's mine the harbor and LBJ does not allow mining of the harbor

Arc Light Attacks
- Central feature of the war
- Arc light strike -- big B-52 bombers (can fly 6 to 7 miles above the earth -- no one on the earth can see or hear them) get called in when there is a military unit in trouble
- Dropped 4x as many bombs in the south as in the north
- Not much data on what the effects are but after the war we know that NV soldiers would report that for them the Arc light attacks were the most terrifying part of the war -- see nothing, and then the ground would just open up

Prisoners of War
- There are many prisoners of war; many are airmen -- aircrew in planes
- There might be a 10-person crew; when they are shotdown, they become prisoners of war
- Famous PoW camp in hanoi, where PoWs and political prisoners were being held
- known as the 'Hanoi Hilton' -- sprawling PoW camp
- Many PoW camps
- Show up on TV from time to time
- Exhibitions where PoWs are taken out of the camps and paraded through the streets, images would be put onf ilm and distributed globally
- Sometimes forced under torture to make claims against the US
- A high-ranking official makes a statement against the war -- blinks eyes such that it spells out 'torture'
- North Vietnamese using PoW as propaganda tools to shame the US
- John McCain, Senator from Arizona -- shot down and in a PoW camp, was filmed as well

US Troops
- 450k troops in Vietnam by 1967
- A small portion are in combat -- 20%
- The rest are support troops -- air crew, mechanics, embassy, etc.
- The army functioned with a well-established racial hierarchy which became very clear in the Vietnam War
- Many jobs in the 'rear' -- often went to white folks. Black folks ended up in the infantry or in a forward position.
- When rear jobs opened up, people would put in for it -- but those jobs often went to white folks and became another part of the war that people at home were criticizing
- By 1967, 800 deaths per month, increasing from what it had been. Greater focus on the DMZ -- 17th parallel between North and South
- More artillery attacks coming from the DMZ -- shelling American marines
- Gave Gen. Westmoreland the idea that there would be attacks and that the NV might overrun the marine posts, became Westmoreland's focus in 1967
- Up to WWI in every war more people die from disease than combat 

Tactics
- US is still dedicated to search and destroy -- still trying to find the enemy
- Vietnamese are using hit and run tactics, not holding up to territory -- not a traditional war in the way that the US is used to it
- Over and over, marine patrols go into the DMZ, fight for some place, and then abandon it, then come fight for it again
- Hills -- the US spends a lot of time taking a hill, and then just abandon it
- From a military strategist perspective this might make sense, but this does not make sense for the soldiers -- increasing dissatisfaction 
- As the war goes on, there is less and less support in the South for a long war

What kind of a war?
- By 1967 -- what is the US really doing?
- VC tactics are pretty successful -- eroding American morale
- Hit-and run tactics, very short battles lastling less than a few minutes
- Really starts to damage morale in the military

	- 1967 estimates: 350k H&I shells killed about 100 enemy soldiers
	- The average soldier is questioning the authority of their leadership
- The Vietnamese guerillas -- not all bombs explode, some are duds (2-3%); they take unexploded ammunitions and rewire them as booby traps and put them in the place where tanks are being used
- Jan-July 1967, 539 Americans KIA, 5.5k wounded, many by booby traps

Tunnel Systems
- Very elaborate tunnel systems, including underneath some of the US military bases
	- 25th Infantry Division base camp had an elaborate tunnel system underneath it

The War of Restraint
- Idea of a 'war of restraint' that the US had certain lines it was not going to cross
- LBj continued to push this idea, but the military continued to fight LBJ and McNumara on this point
- Westmoreland begins talking about the 'crossover point' -- the point where Westmoreland says we are beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel; war of attrition is beginning to favor us, we are killing more of us then they can put back into the field
	- However all of this is incorrect -- either willfully or not

Fulbright hearings, 1966-1971
