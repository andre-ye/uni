## Lecture 1: The 1960s -- A Crisis of National Unity
Unfortunately my notes previously were lost because my computer lost battery and GitHub was stalling :(

- What is meant by consensus? Enough to provide definitiona nd form to the dominant culture
- Consensus over what? What was broken? What happens to the stories which hold the US together?
- American exceptionalism: the grand narrative of US history
- The acceptnace of New Deal liberalism
- WWII entirely changes the coordinates
- High unemployment in the US
- The US is built up by WWII -- the world's leading manufacturing econoy, an explosion of the middle class. WWII shapes everything. The monolith of WWII casts a shadow over everything we talk about. It is the children of WWII who are asked to go to Vietnam.
- Post WWI, we have a hightened sense of the US at its zenith.
- American exceptionalism: a grand narrative of US history after 1945. Defeat of totalitarianism, Nazi Germany, etc. Rebuilding of the ecnoy. A global reputation as a leader.
- Changing the global currency from the British pound to the US dollar. The UN is founded and located in NYC.
- Not simply -- the US as the greatest country in the world, but more importantly, the US and its people are not bound to historical trends and patterns which all other nations adn peoples are bound towards. The central claim of American exceptionalism. You can have coups and militant conflict, but we are these people  for whom the actions on the outside do not apply.
- Jan 6th -- this is not who we are, how could this happen here? We are this other group of people. This is now central to the story of American exceptionalism.
- Four narratives which underwrite post-1945 grad narratives of American exceptionalism: state and society, materialism, social liberation, and just war
- State and society
	- What is the relationship between civil society and the civilian?
	- Because of the origins in the US Constitution, our governmental system has design integrity against corrupt, incompetent individuals.
	- An incorruptability of the government
	- Assassinations, the Vietnam War, responses to civic protests, and **media coverage** destroyed the purity of the system. Thereafter Americans viewed the system as corrupted and elected officials as untrustworthy liars.
	- A nation so broken by the politics of the long 1960s.
	- Public trust in elected officials falls precipitously in the mid 60s.
	- Origin of the culture wars in Bill Clinton
	- high point in public trust after 9/11
	- All time low public trust currently.
	- Narrative of what happens between state and society? Our politics has been profoundly broken. 
- Materialism
	- Rivers catching on fire (Cuyahoga river fire, 1969)
	- Progressive nations, looking forward.
	- "the US has no history"
	- Fear of nuclear war, fallout, the world is falling -- the environment is collapsing. What is going to happen going forward?
	- The future is not necessarily better, and we see in this generation that the future indeed will pose large problems.
- Social liberation.
	- Civil rights -- we see the unacknowledged dominance of white men in society accepted
	- Generally normal, understood, and accepted.
	- "Good white people" (Malcolm X)
	- My life is my life, I'm not directly involved in oppression of black people: that's not my problem. An unchecked sense of superiority
	- Civil rights movements often conflict with each other: for instance there was a heavy dose of chauvanism running in the Black Panther Party.
- War.
	- Previous idea: America fights just wars and always wins.
	- Always in defense, never an aggressor
	- All problematic ideas. Why don't Ameircans know about the Phillipine war? Or much about the Korean war? Indigenous wars?
	- A source of shame emerged in the 1960s from Vietnam etc.: and a need to place **blame**. Who is to be blamed?
	- Americans aren't exceptional -- as demonstrated in Afghanistan.
	- The Civil War: different visions for the future; a radical abolitionist perspective, and also the ameleriorist vision which dominated and produced Jim Crow laws: America does not want to commit the Civil War to memory. Generations later, the Daughters of the Confederacy make the move to build the narrative of *lost cause*: the Confederates were still brave and noble men, just happening to be on the wrong side of the battle -- states rights, etc. 
	- What stories do we tell ourselves about what we are and where we came from?
	- The lost cause vision reinforces a white supremacist vision of America: rebirth of a nation.
	- Why were there so few executions after the Civil War? After the Dakota uprising, 38 Sioux leaders were hung. What kind of reconciliation did America settle with?
- Project idea: Understanding the relationship between analytic philosophers, educational institutions, and radical student movements in the 1960: precisely how analytic philosophy reconciled this with its political neutral and castrated philosophical position.
