# In Review

ENGL 308

I've learned a lot in this class. Here, I write down the key ideas and modes of thinking I've learned.

- *Doing is always a matter of knowing, and knowing is always a matter of seeing.* As agents in the world, what we do is contingent on what we know - what we think we know: our feelings, opinions, belief-systems. What we know -- the titular epistemological question -- is fundamentally a question of how we see. How do institutions and systems obscure -- or, perhaps to better reflect the complex nature of sight, *refract* -- our sight? How do we see, and how can we imagine a new mode of sight?
- *Marxism is about much more than economics.* Most people, me included before the class, understand Marxism as a principally economic doctrine -- with syntactic associations to 'socialism', 'communism', 'Soviet', 'Lenin', and so on. (This very fact is interesting as a question of knowledge and sight.) When one reads Marx's writing and the writing of those that have carried on his work, however, one realizes that Marxism is much more: it is philophical, anthropological, historical, cultural, ethnographical, political, literary. Much of modern intellectual thought is indebted to Marxist modes of thinking, whether it acknowledges it or not.
- *Marxism is not a unified field.* For the same reason as previously mentioned, it seems to be assumed that Marxism is a wholly unified boogeyman other. On the other hand, we find that Marxist intellectual thought is full of rich debate and disagreement: between the optimist and the pessimist, the optimist and the realist, the *pessimist* and the realist, the structuralist and the poststructuralist, the structuralist and the deconstructionist, and so on.

After taking this class, I find myself a pessimist (among Althusserian lines). I will continue to study philosophy, both Marxist and in other schools, with an interest in understanding how people and systems of people produce various dialectic relationships. However, I find myself pessimistic at the moment on the possibility of substantial change (think - Marx's polemic class-collapsing gesture at the conclusion of the *Manifesto*).
