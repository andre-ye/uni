## Week 2 Monday: Presocratic Atomism
- A little bit jarring -- fragments with the presocratics and the Hellenistics
- With Aristotle and atomism, there is a sort of hostility
    - Doing ancient philosophy is a very intentionally hermeneutic operation.
- Looking at pre-Socratic atomism: has to do with Epicurean atomism. Atomism has a historical grounding earlier than Hellenistic philosophy, back to Democritus and Leucippus
- Presocratic metaphysics: the birth of philosophy in Greece marked from a mythological or divine xplanation of natural phenomena (as seen in Hesiod, Homer) to scientific explanations grounded in observable facts.
- "First philosopher" of the Mediterranean: Thales. 
- Motivated by investigations into the arche of the cosmos. There are different ways to translate it: "first principle", what is th eunderlying stuff, the source or starting poitn of reality, the underlying stuff, theoretically basic material, the ultimate explanation, etc. In truth, it is a combination of all of these ideas.
- Some proposals:
    - Thales: water. The fundamental stuff of the cosmos is water.
    - Anaximander: the boundless / apeiron
    - Anaximenes: ether / aer
    - Heraclitus: flux (change) / fire 
- What does it mean to shift from the mythological to the philosophical explanation?

Presocratic Metaphysics After Parmenides
- Parmenides -- shift in ancient philosophy, argues that genuine thohught and knowledge can only be about what-is. what-is-not is unsayable, and unthinkable.
- what-is is whole, complete, unchanging, and one. 
- How can there be no change? Things seem to be always in motion, as Heraclitus observed.
- Parmenides' challenge: deducations are incompatible with previous accounts of the arche, which require changes in/to the arche to explain the natural world.
- *Change presupposes the reality of what-is-not*
- Thales' water -- must change, from what is not to what (now) is.
- Can you identify the arche while preserving change's possibility and meeting Parmenides condition. 

Leucippus and Democritus
- Atomism enters here.
- Leucippus is active around the death of Parmenides; a contemporary of Socrates
- Democritus: the student of Leucippus, a contemporary of Socrates, Plato, maybe a young Aristotle, traveled widely in the ancient world, possibly also to India

Sources
- A number to each Pre-Socratic philosopher: 67B2
    - 67: the number of the philosopher
    - B: a primary source from that philosopher (A: testimony)
    - 2: the second fragment from that source
- Doxographers (e.g. Diogenes Laertius)
- Commentators on Aristotle (e.g. Simplicius, Alexander)
- Aristotle himself: a critic of atomism
    - Atomism is incompatible with the Aristotelian system.
    - Aristotle's philosophical system is teleological; atomism is mechanistic
    - Teleological systems reduce explanations of natural phenomena to the ends or goals of those phenomena
    - Mechanistic systems reduce explanations of natural phenomena to configurations of the most basic entities of that system. 
    - Aristotle, *Generation of Animals*: "Democritus leaves aside purpose but refers all things which nature employs to necessity."

Atomism: The Basics
- Reality is made up of two fundamental constituents, atoms and void
    - Being and non-being
    - What-is and what-is-not
- How to make this okay given Parmenides' restrictions?
- Atom, coming from the Greek *atomos* (uncuttable)

Motivating Atomism
- Puzzles towards a theory of mathematical minima before Leucippus and Democritus, e.g. Zeno's paradoxes
- Democritus traveled to India, and Indian atomism was a thing far before Democritus and Leucippus
- Or, trying to posit a metaphysical theory of the arche which meets Parmenides' challenge

Properties of Atoms

*Key features*
- What is
- Indivisible minima
- Intrinsically unchangeable, and each has a single nature
- Full and solid
- Infinite in number
- Differ from each other in shape, arrangement, and position
- Differ from each other in size
- Too small to perceive on their own, but become perceptible as composites
- Do they have a weight?

*More details*
- Need to come together and become perceptible as a composite
- Atoms are infinite in number
- Atoms themselves have variable qualitative features, differing in size and shape
- Atoms have hooks and rivets that allow them to be rearranged. But they can also detach from each other. When they detach, they retain their nature. Atoms do not become in-themselves different when they attach.
- Compulsion is what moves atoms together into motion
- Vibration?
- Atoms are self-organizing, there is no self-organizer
- Smallness cannot explain uncuttability; they are through and through one substance.
- For Parmenides, what is must be what-is through and through.
- For Democritus, it cannot be a measure of solidity.
- For something to be divided, there must be void in that body.
- Are atoms substance?
- These guys didn't make up haphazard philosophies; they planned this out.
- Kosmos -- just the universe, everything except that which is not. 
    - An atom the size of the kosmos -- theoretical or declarative?
    - To be read in 39 also: there are infinitely many kosmoi
- Perception -- composites emit a sort of film which makes contact with our sensory organs.

Void
- "Nothing", "what is not", "the unlimited"
- The place or location for atoms
- Individuala toms are separated by void, but are compact and cannot contain void (15)
- Void is infinite, and posited to explain
    - The motion of atoms
    - How there can be manyt hings
    - How there can be division

Mechanistic explanation for observable phenomena and change
- Coming-to-be and perishing are explained by the separation and combination of atoms
- Coming-to-be and perishing by means of separation and combination, alteration by means of arrangement and position.
- Features of composites are explained by features of the atoms and their arrangement
- Sense perception is explained byt he shedding of films which make contact with an animal's sense organs.
- "Red" is not real; the only thing that is real is atoms and void. All perceived qualities are real by convention.
- Living things are all chance combinations of atoms... there is no "purpose" to living things and their continued existence on Earth. 

What to focus on for next time:
- What Aristotle's objections to atomism are
- How Aristotle portrays different atomist claims. 
- Does Aristotle's hostility influence the reliability of his reports?
