## Week 2 Monday: Presocratic Atomism
- A little bit jarring -- fragments with the presocratics and the Hellenistics
- With Aristotle and atomism, there is a sort of hostility
    - Doing ancient philosophy is a very intentionally hermeneutic operation.
- Looking at pre-Socratic atomism: has to do with Epicurean atomism. Atomism has a historical grounding earlier than Hellenistic philosophy, back to Democritus and Leucippus
- Presocratic metaphysics: the birth of philosophy in Greece marked from a mythological or divine xplanation of natural phenomena (as seen in Hesiod, Homer) to scientific explanations grounded in observable facts.
- "First philosopher" of the Mediterranean: Thales. 
- Motivated by investigations into the arche of the cosmos. There are different ways to translate it: "first principle", what is th eunderlying stuff, the source or starting poitn of reality, the underlying stuff, theoretically basic material, the ultimate explanation, etc. In truth, it is a combination of all of these ideas.
- Some proposals:
    - Thales: water. The fundamental stuff of the cosmos is water.
    - Anaximander: the boundless / apeiron
    - Anaximenes: ether / aer
    - Heraclitus: flux (change) / fire 
- What does it mean to shift from the mythological to the philosophical explanation?

Presocratic Metaphysics After Parmenides
- Parmenides -- shift in ancient philosophy, argues that genuine thohught and knowledge can only be about what-is. what-is-not is unsayable, and unthinkable.
- what-is is whole, complete, unchanging, and one. 
- How can there be no change? Things seem to be always in motion, as Heraclitus observed.
- Parmenides' challenge: deducations are incompatible with previous accounts of the arche, which require changes in/to the arche to explain the natural world.
- *Change presupposes the reality of what-is-not*
- Thales' water -- must change, from what is not to what (now) is.
- Can you identify the arche while preserving change's possibility and meeting Parmenides condition. 

Leucippus and Democritus
- Atomism enters here.
- Leucippus is active around the death of Parmenides; a contemporary of Socrates
- Democritus: the student of Leucippus, a contemporary of Socrates, Plato, maybe a young Aristotle, traveled widely in the ancient world, possibly also to India

Sources
- A number to each Pre-Socratic philosopher: 67B2
    - 67: the number of the philosopher
    - B: a primary source from that philosopher (A: testimony)
    - 2: the second fragment from that source
- Doxographers (e.g. Diogenes Laertius)
- Commentators on Aristotle (e.g. Simplicius, Alexander)
- Aristotle himself: a critic of atomism
    - Atomism is incompatible with the Aristotelian system.
    - Aristotle's philosophical system is teleological; atomism is mechanistic
    - Teleological systems reduce explanations of natural phenomena to the ends or goals of those phenomena
    - Mechanistic systems reduce explanations of natural phenomena to configurations of the most basic entities of that system. 
    - Aristotle, *Generation of Animals*: "Democritus leaves aside purpose but refers all things which nature employs to necessity."

Atomism: The Basics
- Reality is made up of two fundamental constituents, atoms and void
    - Being and non-being
    - What-is and what-is-not
- How to make this okay given Parmenides' restrictions?
- Atom, coming from the Greek *atomos* (uncuttable)

Motivating Atomism
- Puzzles towards a theory of mathematical minima before Leucippus and Democritus, e.g. Zeno's paradoxes
- Democritus traveled to India, and Indian atomism was a thing far before Democritus and Leucippus
- Or, trying to posit a metaphysical theory of the arche which meets Parmenides' challenge

Properties of Atoms

*Key features*
- What is
- Indivisible minima
- Intrinsically unchangeable, and each has a single nature
- Full and solid
- Infinite in number
- Differ from each other in shape, arrangement, and position
- Differ from each other in size
- Too small to perceive on their own, but become perceptible as composites
- Do they have a weight?

*More details*
- Need to come together and become perceptible as a composite
- Atoms are infinite in number
- Atoms themselves have variable qualitative features, differing in size and shape
- Atoms have hooks and rivets that allow them to be rearranged. But they can also detach from each other. When they detach, they retain their nature. Atoms do not become in-themselves different when they attach.
- Compulsion is what moves atoms together into motion
- Vibration?
- Atoms are self-organizing, there is no self-organizer
- Smallness cannot explain uncuttability; they are through and through one substance.
- For Parmenides, what is must be what-is through and through.
- For Democritus, it cannot be a measure of solidity.
- For something to be divided, there must be void in that body.
- Are atoms substance?
- These guys didn't make up haphazard philosophies; they planned this out.
- Kosmos -- just the universe, everything except that which is not. 
    - An atom the size of the kosmos -- theoretical or declarative?
    - To be read in 39 also: there are infinitely many kosmoi
- Perception -- composites emit a sort of film which makes contact with our sensory organs.

Void
- "Nothing", "what is not", "the unlimited"
- The place or location for atoms
- Individuala toms are separated by void, but are compact and cannot contain void (15)
- Void is infinite, and posited to explain
    - The motion of atoms
    - How there can be manyt hings
    - How there can be division

Mechanistic explanation for observable phenomena and change
- Coming-to-be and perishing are explained by the separation and combination of atoms
- Coming-to-be and perishing by means of separation and combination, alteration by means of arrangement and position.
- Features of composites are explained by features of the atoms and their arrangement
- Sense perception is explained byt he shedding of films which make contact with an animal's sense organs.
- "Red" is not real; the only thing that is real is atoms and void. All perceived qualities are real by convention.
- Living things are all chance combinations of atoms... there is no "purpose" to living things and their continued existence on Earth. 

What to focus on for next time:
- What Aristotle's objections to atomism are
- How Aristotle portrays different atomist claims. 
- Does Aristotle's hostility influence the reliability of his reports?

## Week 2 Wednesday: Aristotle Against the Presocratic Atomists

Detour -- how is this metaphysics?
- 'Meta' as a prefix for 'after': 'this treatise comes after the physics'
- Or: 'meta' as a prefix for 'beyond': 'this treatise comes beyond the physics, concerns matters beyond the contents covered in the *Physics*'
- Physics is the science of change, includig the natural world
- Metaphysics: the science of unchanging things (first principles), the study of being as such, first causes, theology, etc.
- In antiquity, astronomy, biology, physics, etc. are all considered to be part of philosophy; but in the 17th century, we get a split between metaphysics and physics. "Physics" becomes a sort of specialized kind of quantiative science. Topics like free will, personal identity, mind-body etc. are recategorized as metaphysics.
    - Ontology: study of being
- What Aristotle thinks of as metaphysics becomes recontextualized as ontology. 
- Can anything be called metaphysics in ancient philosophy? Is anything unchanging or is it all changing?

Aristotle's Endoxa
- Why is there so much of Democritus in Aristotle?
- Aristotle tends to survey the views of previous thinkers before getting into his own theorizing
- This is *endoxa* -- reputable opinions / commonly accepted views. These are starting points for inquiry. Has a sort of respect for these endoxa.
- *On Generation and Corruption* -- Democritus is the first to have seriously explored the question of non-being.
- Inclusion in endoxa does not indicate agreement.

*On Generation and Corruption*
- Context: an investigation on coming-to-be (generation) and passing-away (corruption).
- Growth / alteration vs generation / corruption?
- Is all generation alteration?
- If the universe is one thing, coming to be is alteration
- Unqualified generation and corruption: can these things occur, and if so, how?
- First question Aristotle wants to address @ 315b25: "Do things come-to-be and alter and grow, and undergo the contrary changes, because the primary things are invisible magnitudes? Or is no magnitude indivisible?"
    - If primary things are indivisble magnitudes, are they bodies (Democritus and Leucippus) or planes (Plato, geometric atomism)
- Reductio at 316a23: assume a body is divisible through-and-through. What happens?
    - What is left is a magnitude. This is impossible because then there is something which has not been divided yet.
    - What is left is absolutely nothing. That would mean that body is generated ex nihilo and is a composite of nothing. but what if it's a composit of points / contacts? Contacts and points have to be of things which are not points or contacts themselves.
    - **objection**: isn't asking the question "what is left" already begging the question?
- 316b15: both options have unacceptable consequences, so there must be indivisible bodies.

Establishing Invisible Bodies and Magnitudes (The Setup)
- 316b15: reductio. Assume there are indivisible bodies and magnitudes. 
    - For atoms, every composite value is both actually indivisible and potentially divisible. But if a body were divisible at every point, if it were divided at every point simultaneously, then nothing would remain. It would need to be generated ex nihilo or out of points, which is unacceptable.
- Aristotle sets forth conditions for the existence of atoms. Dividing a body is not a process which can continue to infinity; there must be a limit to division.
- Generation and corruption as combination and separation require minimal parts.

Against Indivisible Bodies and Magnitudes
- 317a8: Bodies can only be divisible through and through in one sense. 
- The atomists introduce minimal parts to block infinite divisibility. 
- Aristotle says that through-and-through divisibility is impossible, but introducing minimal parts renders it incoherent.
- What exactly is through-and-through division? Is there a concept of points?

A Big-picture Problem with Atomism in *Generation and Corruption*
- Unqualified generation and corruption can't happen by combination and separation anyway
- Generation and corruption happen when something changes from one thing to another, changing its definition and material factors.
- Alterations are mere changes to a thing's accidental features
- Problems have to do with divisibility -- it cannot account for coming-to-be and passing-away

*On the Heavens*, III.4
- Are the elements finite or infinite in number?
- "Elements" as in basic constituents, e.g. atoms, as opposed to elements as in fire, earth, ...
- 303a3: for the atomists, all things are composed of four types of elements. The atoms which compose different elements do so by virtue of their different shape and size. But this means that elements cannot be generated out of one another.
- Aristotle's problem with atomism: elements change into one another, this sort of theory can't account for that, you will run out of stuff from which you can get your elements.
- 303a30: If you want to say that infinite elements differ infinitely, then you can only have as much as the principles of pyramidss.
- Grounded more in elements "int he real/material world.
- Atoms have their own simple motions, but the number of simple motions is not infinite, so there cannot be infinite atoms. 

*Physics*, IV.6-8, Problems with Void
- Does Void exist? How does it exist? What is it?
- "Void" is a kind of place or vessel which becomes full when it holds "the bulk" and void when it is deprived of this bulk.
- Are there different kinds of space for Democritus and Epicurus?
- From Democritus and Leucippus: void is an interval that divided the whole body in a way that breaks its continuity.
- Aristotle outlines reasons why people posit the existence of void and offer some refutations
    - Motion argument: void is needed for change in place. What is full cannot contain anything more than any one body. Needed for change in place.
        - But this is going to suggest that multiple bodies can be in the same place. And that means that unequal bodies can occupy the same place at the same time, so the smallest body might contain the larger body, which is incoherent.
        - Atoms are finite in kind, but the number of atoms is infinite, for Leucippus and Democritus.
    - Contraction argument: there are pockets of void inside what is being contracted, void is being squeezed out of it
    - Expansion argument: there are pockets of void inside what is being expanded, composite bodies potentially contain void.
- Responses
    - Against the motion argument: bodies can simultaneously make room for each other without needing to move into an empty space. Example: swimming underwater. But... really? Surely water must be moved... void has to exist.
    - Against the argument from contraction: what is squeezed out doesn't have to be void.
    - Against the argument from increase: qualitative change can make sense of expansion / increase -- it doesn't need to be void entering the water. 
- More on motion and the void:
    - If something moves into the void, it becomes differentiated, but void is uniform. So it can't explain motion.
    - Things move into void because void yields; if void is uniform, it should yield everywhere. So everything moves everywhere. 
- In general, Aristotle attacks if atomism can make sense of elemental theories of elements as building blocks in the natural world, divisibility and the theory of the void.
- Is Epicurean atomism projecting backwards onto Leucippus and Democritus? 
- Do the Epicureans respond to Aristotle?

## Epicureanism
- Epicurus and Lucretius -- just starting and ending the Hellenistic period

Epicurus
- Born in Samos, 341 BC
- Friendship with Nausiphanes (Democritean) in his youth
- Even though Nausiphanes had some influence on Epicurus, Epicurus later was very critical of Nausiphanes
- Epicurus moves to Athens for military service, is a teacher, then establishes a philosophical school.
- "The Garden" -- a house between Athens and the Piraeus. So now it's a typical way to refer to Epicurean school
    - More of a society of friedns who lived in accordance with common principles
    - Friendship is very significant in Epicurean ethics
    - The Garden is a realization of friendship. Admitted women, admitted slaves
    - Is Epicureanism a sort of precursor to the Christian ethical revolt?
- Are ancient schools research/teaching institutions or religious communities? Epicurus' garden is more of a religious community.
- Epicurus is very prolific, wrote a very large number of books but very few survivedd.
    - *To Herodotus* (principles of atomism)
    - *Letter to Menoeceus* (moral theory)
    - *Letter to Pythocles* (astronomy)
- We also rely on the Roman poet Lucretius

Lucretius
- A roman poet, an Epicurean who presents Epicureanism as the only source of human salvation
- Wrote more than 200 years after Epicurus' death
- Amplifies and explains points form Epicurus' own writings
- *De Rerum Natura*, famous work

Other sources on Epicureanism
- Diogenese Laertius (doxographer). Emphasis often varies, some aspects might be emphasized more than others
- Cicero, Seneca, Plutarch, Sextus Empiricus, Diogenes of Oenoanda
- Cicero & Plutarch dislike Epicureanism
- Seneca is a Roman Stoic
- Sextus Empiricus, thinks of Epicureanism as the most congenial of the dogmatic schools. -- so against Epicureanism, but friendly to it than stoicism
- Diogenes of Oenanda is a late Epicurean -- inscribed Epicurus' teaching into a wall

Epicurean Philosophy: An Overview
- Empiricism: sensations and feelings are the only foundation for knowledge
- Provides rules for the attainment of a tranquil life; pleasure, defined as the absence/removal of pain, is the only good
    - Ataraxia -- "freedom from disturbance", i.e. tranquility
- How to show the validity of Hedonism? Appeals to immediate experience. Grounded in an empiricism. All living things pursue pleasure and avoid pain.
- Pleasure is the only good in and of itself
- What to think about? -- well-being as being a natural condition of living things, how does atomism fit in with this?
- Surely Epicurus would have abandoned metaphysical theorizing. Yet he still tires to grasp the fundamental structure of reality a priori with the use of any a priori principles. 

The Principles of Conservation
- A set of laws that underline the permannce of the constitutents of reality.
- Directly from Epicurus, so holds the most weight. 

Principle 1: Nothing comes into being out of what is not
- If things come into being out of nothing, they might come into existence under whatever conditions ever.
- Lucretious explains the absurdity of this principle
- Aristotle: when you plot a type of seed, you get a specific type of result.
- The generation of things follows a certain pattern. 
- "Seeds" -- a thing in Lucretius, biological seeds but also a way to talk about atoms -- what is it doing for biology, but also atomism?
- Something seems sus about this... is the nothing / everything negation valid?

Principle 2: Nothing perishes into nothing.
- Lucretius gives us the empirical grounding for these things
- If things perished into nothing, everything would have disappeared. This is not true. Therefore, it is not the case that things perish into nothing.
- Observation about the nature of destruction. Destruction is not instantaneous.
- If things perished into nothing, destruction would be instantaneous. It is not instantaneous. It is not the case that things perish into nothing.
- These underly most of greek philosophy before the Epicureans -- these are not new principles, even before Parmenides. What is new about Epicurus' formulation is that these two principles have an empirical tone. It is a pointed empiricsm.
- Epicurus' possible response to the ship of theseus -- we can't have an essence / identity of things, but if the atomic makeup of things changes, then the thing itself changes.

Principle 3: The totality of things is unchanging.
- Totality: the universe, everything
- What is the scope of this principle
- Nothing in addition to atoms and void can be added or subtracted.
- Do they consider the a priori principles for the totality of things?
- 5A in L&S is 4A continued
- The totality of things is bodies and void. Rules out change by addition, subtraction, generation, corruption, and prohibits something changing into itself through text D.
- Epicurus whittles down a familiar empirical universe to the most fundamental, primary components.
- Premise 1: if the totality of things changed, there would be something into which it changes.
- Premise 2: there is not anything into which it changes.
- What are the limitations imposed by empirciism? Should apply equally to body and void.
- Do these principles apply to void?
- These laws of conservation prohibit change in the basic composition of the universe, whether by generation of new things, destruction of what already exists, removing parts, etc. 

The Basic Division: Totality as Body and Void
- "Totality" = body + void
    - Both are 3-d extended
    - Body is intangible, void is intangible.
    - Body can act or be acted upon (always bumping into each other), but body can't bump into void; void has the capacity to house things which can act or be acted upon
    - Body coming to occupy void
- Narrative on the definition of body: Stoicism, bodies acted and being acted upon.
- Different kinds of void -- room, place, void, etc.
- We can make the seemingly contradictory texts: difference in types of void is one of essence, but of context. 
- Void is a condition for the existence of bodies
- Empiricism is still fundamental -- the inference is grounded in the observable.
- Interesting how empricism needs to post anti-empirical bodies to be internally coherent
- Properties are all accidents of body; they're not separate things, but aspects of bodies. 

Argument for the completeness of the body-void dichotomy
- Body which has resistance
- Void as that which does not have resistance
- Body as that which can act or be acted upon
