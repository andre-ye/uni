## Week 2 Monday: Presocratic Atomism
- A little bit jarring -- fragments with the presocratics and the Hellenistics
- With Aristotle and atomism, there is a sort of hostility
    - Doing ancient philosophy is a very intentionally hermeneutic operation.
- Looking at pre-Socratic atomism: has to do with Epicurean atomism. Atomism has a historical grounding earlier than Hellenistic philosophy, back to Democritus and Leucippus
- Presocratic metaphysics: the birth of philosophy in Greece marked from a mythological or divine xplanation of natural phenomena (as seen in Hesiod, Homer) to scientific explanations grounded in observable facts.
- "First philosopher" of the Mediterranean: Thales. 
- Motivated by investigations into the arche of the cosmos. There are different ways to translate it: "first principle", what is th eunderlying stuff, the source or starting poitn of reality, the underlying stuff, theoretically basic material, the ultimate explanation, etc. In truth, it is a combination of all of these ideas.
- Some proposals:
    - Thales: water. The fundamental stuff of the cosmos is water.
    - Anaximander: the boundless / apeiron
    - Anaximenes: ether / aer
    - Heraclitus: flux (change) / fire 
- What does it mean to shift from the mythological to the philosophical explanation?

Presocratic Metaphysics After Parmenides
- Parmenides -- shift in ancient philosophy, argues that genuine thohught and knowledge can only be about what-is. what-is-not is unsayable, and unthinkable.
- what-is is whole, complete, unchanging, and one. 
- How can there be no change? Things seem to be always in motion, as Heraclitus observed.
- Parmenides' challenge: deducations are incompatible with previous accounts of the arche, which require changes in/to the arche to explain the natural world.
- *Change presupposes the reality of what-is-not*
- Thales' water -- must change, from what is not to what (now) is.
- Can you identify the arche while preserving change's possibility and meeting Parmenides condition. 

Leucippus and Democritus
- Atomism enters here.
- Leucippus is active around the death of Parmenides; a contemporary of Socrates
- Democritus: the student of Leucippus, a contemporary of Socrates, Plato, maybe a young Aristotle, traveled widely in the ancient world, possibly also to India

Sources
- A number to each Pre-Socratic philosopher: 67B2
    - 67: the number of the philosopher
    - B: a primary source from that philosopher (A: testimony)
    - 2: the second fragment from that source
- Doxographers (e.g. Diogenes Laertius)
- Commentators on Aristotle (e.g. Simplicius, Alexander)
- Aristotle himself: a critic of atomism
    - Atomism is incompatible with the Aristotelian system.
    - Aristotle's philosophical system is teleological; atomism is mechanistic
    - Teleological systems reduce explanations of natural phenomena to the ends or goals of those phenomena
    - Mechanistic systems reduce explanations of natural phenomena to configurations of the most basic entities of that system. 
    - Aristotle, *Generation of Animals*: "Democritus leaves aside purpose but refers all things which nature employs to necessity."

Atomism: The Basics
- Reality is made up of two fundamental constituents, atoms and void
    - Being and non-being
    - What-is and what-is-not
- How to make this okay given Parmenides' restrictions?
- Atom, coming from the Greek *atomos* (uncuttable)

Motivating Atomism
- Puzzles towards a theory of mathematical minima before Leucippus and Democritus, e.g. Zeno's paradoxes
- Democritus traveled to India, and Indian atomism was a thing far before Democritus and Leucippus
- Or, trying to posit a metaphysical theory of the arche which meets Parmenides' challenge

Properties of Atoms

*Key features*
- What is
- Indivisible minima
- Intrinsically unchangeable, and each has a single nature
- Full and solid
- Infinite in number
- Differ from each other in shape, arrangement, and position
- Differ from each other in size
- Too small to perceive on their own, but become perceptible as composites
- Do they have a weight?

*More details*
- Need to come together and become perceptible as a composite
- Atoms are infinite in number
- Atoms themselves have variable qualitative features, differing in size and shape
- Atoms have hooks and rivets that allow them to be rearranged. But they can also detach from each other. When they detach, they retain their nature. Atoms do not become in-themselves different when they attach.
- Compulsion is what moves atoms together into motion
- Vibration?
- Atoms are self-organizing, there is no self-organizer
- Smallness cannot explain uncuttability; they are through and through one substance.
- For Parmenides, what is must be what-is through and through.
- For Democritus, it cannot be a measure of solidity.
- For something to be divided, there must be void in that body.
- Are atoms substance?
- These guys didn't make up haphazard philosophies; they planned this out.
- Kosmos -- just the universe, everything except that which is not. 
    - An atom the size of the kosmos -- theoretical or declarative?
    - To be read in 39 also: there are infinitely many kosmoi
- Perception -- composites emit a sort of film which makes contact with our sensory organs.

Void
- "Nothing", "what is not", "the unlimited"
- The place or location for atoms
- Individuala toms are separated by void, but are compact and cannot contain void (15)
- Void is infinite, and posited to explain
    - The motion of atoms
    - How there can be manyt hings
    - How there can be division

Mechanistic explanation for observable phenomena and change
- Coming-to-be and perishing are explained by the separation and combination of atoms
- Coming-to-be and perishing by means of separation and combination, alteration by means of arrangement and position.
- Features of composites are explained by features of the atoms and their arrangement
- Sense perception is explained byt he shedding of films which make contact with an animal's sense organs.
- "Red" is not real; the only thing that is real is atoms and void. All perceived qualities are real by convention.
- Living things are all chance combinations of atoms... there is no "purpose" to living things and their continued existence on Earth. 

What to focus on for next time:
- What Aristotle's objections to atomism are
- How Aristotle portrays different atomist claims. 
- Does Aristotle's hostility influence the reliability of his reports?

## Week 2 Wednesday: Aristotle Against the Presocratic Atomists

Detour -- how is this metaphysics?
- 'Meta' as a prefix for 'after': 'this treatise comes after the physics'
- Or: 'meta' as a prefix for 'beyond': 'this treatise comes beyond the physics, concerns matters beyond the contents covered in the *Physics*'
- Physics is the science of change, includig the natural world
- Metaphysics: the science of unchanging things (first principles), the study of being as such, first causes, theology, etc.
- In antiquity, astronomy, biology, physics, etc. are all considered to be part of philosophy; but in the 17th century, we get a split between metaphysics and physics. "Physics" becomes a sort of specialized kind of quantiative science. Topics like free will, personal identity, mind-body etc. are recategorized as metaphysics.
    - Ontology: study of being
- What Aristotle thinks of as metaphysics becomes recontextualized as ontology. 
- Can anything be called metaphysics in ancient philosophy? Is anything unchanging or is it all changing?

Aristotle's Endoxa
- Why is there so much of Democritus in Aristotle?
- Aristotle tends to survey the views of previous thinkers before getting into his own theorizing
- This is *endoxa* -- reputable opinions / commonly accepted views. These are starting points for inquiry. Has a sort of respect for these endoxa.
- *On Generation and Corruption* -- Democritus is the first to have seriously explored the question of non-being.
- Inclusion in endoxa does not indicate agreement.

*On Generation and Corruption*
- Context: an investigation on coming-to-be (generation) and passing-away (corruption).
- Growth / alteration vs generation / corruption?
- Is all generation alteration?
- If the universe is one thing, coming to be is alteration
- Unqualified generation and corruption: can these things occur, and if so, how?
- First question Aristotle wants to address @ 315b25: "Do things come-to-be and alter and grow, and undergo the contrary changes, because the primary things are invisible magnitudes? Or is no magnitude indivisible?"
    - If primary things are indivisble magnitudes, are they bodies (Democritus and Leucippus) or planes (Plato, geometric atomism)
- Reductio at 316a23: assume a body is divisible through-and-through. What happens?
    - What is left is a magnitude. This is impossible because then there is something which has not been divided yet.
    - What is left is absolutely nothing. That would mean that body is generated ex nihilo and is a composite of nothing. but what if it's a composit of points / contacts? Contacts and points have to be of things which are not points or contacts themselves.
    - **objection**: isn't asking the question "what is left" already begging the question?
- 316b15: both options have unacceptable consequences, so there must be indivisible bodies.

Establishing Invisible Bodies and Magnitudes (The Setup)
- 316b15: reductio. Assume there are indivisible bodies and magnitudes. 
    - For atoms, every composite value is both actually indivisible and potentially divisible. But if a body were divisible at every point, if it were divided at every point simultaneously, then nothing would remain. It would need to be generated ex nihilo or out of points, which is unacceptable.
- Aristotle sets forth conditions for the existence of atoms. Dividing a body is not a process which can continue to infinity; there must be a limit to division.
- Generation and corruption as combination and separation require minimal parts.

Against Indivisible Bodies and Magnitudes
- 317a8: Bodies can only be divisible through and through in one sense. 
- The atomists introduce minimal parts to block infinite divisibility. 
- Aristotle says that through-and-through divisibility is impossible, but introducing minimal parts renders it incoherent.
- What exactly is through-and-through division? Is there a concept of points?

A Big-picture Problem with Atomism in *Generation and Corruption*
- Unqualified generation and corruption can't happen by combination and separation anyway
- Generation and corruption happen when something changes from one thing to another, changing its definition and material factors.
- Alterations are mere changes to a thing's accidental features
- Problems have to do with divisibility -- it cannot account for coming-to-be and passing-away

*On the Heavens*, III.4
- Are the elements finite or infinite in number?
- "Elements" as in basic constituents, e.g. atoms, as opposed to elements as in fire, earth, ...
- 303a3: for the atomists, all things are composed of four types of elements. The atoms which compose different elements do so by virtue of their different shape and size. But this means that elements cannot be generated out of one another.
- Aristotle's problem with atomism: elements change into one another, this sort of theory can't account for that, you will run out of stuff from which you can get your elements.
- 303a30: If you want to say that infinite elements differ infinitely, then you can only have as much as the principles of pyramidss.
- Grounded more in elements "int he real/material world.
- Atoms have their own simple motions, but the number of simple motions is not infinite, so there cannot be infinite atoms. 

*Physics*, IV.6-8, Problems with Void
- Does Void exist? How does it exist? What is it?
- "Void" is a kind of place or vessel which becomes full when it holds "the bulk" and void when it is deprived of this bulk.
- Are there different kinds of space for Democritus and Epicurus?
- From Democritus and Leucippus: void is an interval that divided the whole body in a way that breaks its continuity.
- Aristotle outlines reasons why people posit the existence of void and offer some refutations
    - Motion argument: void is needed for change in place. What is full cannot contain anything more than any one body. Needed for change in place.
        - But this is going to suggest that multiple bodies can be in the same place. And that means that unequal bodies can occupy the same place at the same time, so the smallest body might contain the larger body, which is incoherent.
        - Atoms are finite in kind, but the number of atoms is infinite, for Leucippus and Democritus.
    - Contraction argument: there are pockets of void inside what is being contracted, void is being squeezed out of it
    - Expansion argument: there are pockets of void inside what is being expanded, composite bodies potentially contain void.
- Responses
    - Against the motion argument: bodies can simultaneously make room for each other without needing to move into an empty space. Example: swimming underwater. But... really? Surely water must be moved... void has to exist.
    - Against the argument from contraction: what is squeezed out doesn't have to be void.
    - Against the argument from increase: qualitative change can make sense of expansion / increase -- it doesn't need to be void entering the water. 
- More on motion and the void:
    - If something moves into the void, it becomes differentiated, but void is uniform. So it can't explain motion.
    - Things move into void because void yields; if void is uniform, it should yield everywhere. So everything moves everywhere. 
- In general, Aristotle attacks if atomism can make sense of elemental theories of elements as building blocks in the natural world, divisibility and the theory of the void.
- Is Epicurean atomism projecting backwards onto Leucippus and Democritus? 
- Do the Epicureans respond to Aristotle?
