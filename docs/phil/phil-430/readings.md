## Preoscratic Atomism

### Leucippus and Democritus Fragments
"Fifth-Century Atomism", from Curd & McKirahan, *Presocratics Reader*

- Leucippus -- the founding theorist of atomism, 440 to 430 BCE
- Democritus -- the most important atomist, and the first to write a book on the subject.- Epicurus even denied Leucipus existed.
- Concentration on atomism, a scientific and metaphysical theory begun by Leucippus and continued by Democritus.
- Atomism is in conflict to the teleological systems of Plato and Aristotle
- *Atomos* -- uncuttable. Atoms cannot be divided. There are an indefinite number of atoms. Atoms are imperceptible. All atomic stuff is the same. *Being*
- **The empty* / *void* -- void is where atoms are not. Atoms can move into the empty. *Nothingness*
    - Is nothingness somehting which exists? As a being?
    - Not simply the negation of what is
    - Void separates atoms
    - What appears to be coming and passing is merely arrangement of atoms and voids

1. All things are a result of reason and necessity -- determinism? Mechanism? "Materialism"?
2. The universe is both the empty (void) and the full. There is a sort of necessary entanglemetn / self-relating.
3. There are three modes of atomic expression: shape, arrangement, position, and these differences *cause* everything else. Aristotle: what is the "original cause"?
4. Democratic and Leucippus now propose a theory of lateration and coming-to-be. Being and non-being through separation/combination, alteration through arrangement/position. *Truth is in the appearance*; "opposite" things are merely same arrangements
    - "For tragedy and comedy come to be out of the same letters."
5. Democritus: eternal things are small substances (*ousia*, *ousiai*) in infinite quantity.
    - They inhabit the void, nothing, the unlimited
    - Substances are compact, finite, 'existing' 
    - Substances form visible / perceptible bodies
    - Substances *are at odds* (fundamental contradiction?) and move around the void
    - *Ousiai can become entangled, but never really one.*
6. Leucippus posited atoms as infinite, in contrast to the finitude of Parmenides and Xenophanes.
    - What is is no more than what is not. *Sartre?*
    - Infinite principles account for all attributes and substances
    - What is the cause of infiniteness?
7. Early philosophers hold that what-is is one and immovable. But Leucippus says: there can be no motion without void, and the things are infinite in number and invisible because of their smallness.
    - **Question!** Why atomism vs infinite divisibility of the world? And why not a finite number of atoms?
    - Atoms produce coming to be by combining and perishing, they generate compounds by becoming combined.
    - Plurality cannot come from what is actually merely one.
8. Each atom's nature is *one*.
9. Plato and Democritus -- only intelligible things are true/real. There is no perceptible substrate, since atoms have a nature without perceptibility.
    - What is a substrate?
10. Democritus: atoms have size and shape. Epicurus: weight.
11. Bodies differ in shape. Shapes are infinite. Simple bodies should be infinite.
12. Principles are infinite "in multitude" (???); atoms are indivisible and cannot be affected b/c they have no void.
    - Division: when there is void in bodies.
13. Bodies are composed of indivisible things; we reject division to infinity.
14. What is there which escapes division? There will always b esomehting which has not yet been divided. Magnitudes cannot be composed of contacts or points, so there must be indivisible bodies... (???) -- **need some clarification on the necessary existence of an indivisible body.**
15. Democritus does not mean "contact" in the sense of "touching", but rather being near each other. Atoms will always be separated by void.
16. There is no more reason for the thing to be than the nothing. Void has a nature / existence of its own, too.
17. "Void" -- an interval with no perceptible body. Everything that is, is body; so there must be no interval different from bodies (???). If there was,
    - there would be no change in place
18. Leucippus and Democrotisu -- say that primary bodies are walways moving in the void / infinite.
19. They say that there is always motion. But they do not state what kind of motion.
20. Motion occurs because of the void. Nature undergoes motion.
21. Democritus: Primary bodies are always moving in the infinite void by compulsion.
22. Democritus: atoms are by nature motionless, but they "move by a blow" (???)
23. Democritus: primary bodies do not possess weight but strike against each other in the infinite
    - **Question!** What does it mean that there can be an atom the size of the kosmos?
24. Leucippus and Democritus: atoms strike and hit each other, but what is the source? Striking is compelled rather than natural.
25. Atoms move with respect to place through the void. They are merely "hurled about". **But what is the original cause of the motion?** Is this a sort of perpetual motion state?
26. Democritus: there is one kind of motion, pulsation.
27. What explains different densities? The void is enclosed, or what?
28. Democritus leaves aside purpose, and refers to all things in nature as necessary.
29. Democritus says that atoms knock against each other.
30. Democritus employs chance, but chance is the cause of nothing...
31. Atoms are separate in the infinite void; they may rebound or they may be entangled by theri shapes, sizes, positions, and arrangements.
32. Atomic substances infinite in number, are incapable of acting or being acted on, and are merely scattered in the void. **All things are forms**; there is nothing else.
33. ?? cones and shit
34. Some bodies come to be hot and fiery by virtue of differences in shape and position.
35. ?? he makes sweet...??
36. Iron is harder, lead is heavier; iron has unevenly arranged atoms and large quantities of void in many places
37. Leucippus says the universe is infinite. Some is full and some is empty. The full and the void are elements. An infinite nubmer of kosmoi arise and perish from these. Bodies move into the great void and coagulate into a vortex; atoms entangle together to form spherical complexes like membranes. 
38. Animals flock together with animals of the same kind. But it is so true for inanimate things.
39. There are an infinite number of kosmoi of different sizes. **Is this multi-universe theory?**
40. The orbit of the sun is furthest out; the moon is nearest. The stars are on fire, and the sun is on fire.
41. Thunder results from an uneven compound forcing the surrounding cloud to move downward. Lightning is the collision of clouds.
42. The soul moves the body.
43. The visaul impression is formed between the eye and the object is contracted and stamped. Air forms an impression in the eyes. **Light?**
44. Democritus condemns teh senses. We understand nothing exactly.
45. There are bastard judgements (sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch) and legitimate judgements (?).
46. All senses are by convention; in reality, they are atoms and void.
47. A person must know that he is separated from reality.
48. People are at a loss to know in reality what each thing is like.
49. We know nothing about anything "in reality", each opinion is a reshaping of soul-atoms. **Wise-man problem!**
50. Intelligence is supposed to be sensation, and so what appears to our sense must be true or real.
51. In reality, we know nothing, for truth lies below, int he depths.
52. ?? wretched mind o sum shit
53. Democritus: certain images of atoms approach humans, and some cause good and others evil. They are difficult to destroy, but not indestructible.
54. Cheerfulness arises in people through moderation of enjoyment and equal proportion.
55. The goal of life is cheerfulness, not pleasure. Well-being, flourishing, etc. -- disturbed by no emotino.
56. Accept nothing pleasant unless it is beneficial.
57. To all humans the same thing is good and true, but different people find different things pleasant. Good is unvirersal?
58. Brave is he who masters pleasures. "Some are lords of cities but slaves of women."
59. Nature and teaching are closely related. Teaching reshapes the person and makes his nature.
60. A person is best to live his life cheerfully adn without distress. He can do this if he does not take pleasure in mortal things.
61. All those who make pleasures of the belly, will have pleasure as long as they eat or drink, but many pains.
