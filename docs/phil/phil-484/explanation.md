## Scientific Explanation (SEP)
[Source](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-explanation/){:target="_blank"}

Background and Introduction
- What is 'scientific explanation'?
  - What is 'scientific' about an explanation?
  - What makes science 'explanatory'?
- It is possible for claims to be true and unexplanatory.
- Description vs explanation. 
- Are all scientific explanations causal?
- Causal vs non-causal explanations

The DN Model
- Deductive-Nomological Model: a scientific explanation has an explanandum and an explanans
  - Explanandum: describing the phenomenon to be explained
  - Expanans: the class of sentences adduced to account for the phenomenon
- The explanation is a sound deductive argument which follows from the explanans (deductive)
- The explanans must have at least one law of nature (essential premise) (nomological)
- What is a law of nature? SOme generalizations are laws and others are accidentally true.
- Generalizations which are laws can explain why... maybe?
- Are laws exceptionless generalizations?
- DN captures explanation via deduction. What about statistical laws?
- Deductive-statistical explanation: deduction of narrower statistical uniformity.
- Inductive-Statistical explanation: explanandum and explanans relationship is inductive
- Which should all or some explanations have DN or IS structure?
- We need to show that the phenomenon resulted from particular circumstances.

> "the essence of scientific explanation can be described as nomic expectability—that is expectability on the basis of lawful connections."

- Role of causal claims in scientific explanation: are all explanations causal?
- All causal claims imply some sort of regularity -- law
- Explanations should satisfy the DN/IS model because of the requirement of causal claims.
- DN as necessary vs sufficient conditions for explanations
- Is explanation asymmetric? You can only go in one direction of initial conditions towards an outcome
- A derivation can satisfy DN and still contain irrelivances
- DN does not even state necessary conditions for successful explanation -- maybe.


The SR Model
- Wesley Salmon's statistical relevance model.
- Class/population $$A$$; attribute $$C$$ is statistically relevant to another attribute $$B$$ iff $$P(B \mid A \wedge C) \neq P(B \mid A)$$
- Statistically relevnat properties are explanatory.
- Homogenous partition: a set of subclasses which are mutually exclusive adn exhausted. Allows us to characterize SR mdoels more precisely.
- An explanation is not an argument (vs. DN/IS). It is an assembly of statistically relevant information.
- Irrelevancies are harmless in arguments but fatal in explanations -- Salmon
- Once an SR model has been constructed, no other factors can distinguish outcomes.
- Generally -- what do statistical theories explain?
- Does it make sense to use a single model to capture all examples?
- A more radical question: does it even make sense to think statistically to begin with?
- Explanations should cite causal relationships

The Casual Mechanical Model
- Causal process theories of causation -- overcome facts of statistical relevance
- Causal process: a physical process which transmits a mark in a continuous way. 
- A mark is a local modification on the structure of a process.
- Marks persist at other spatio-temporal locations even without more interaction
- Pseudo-processes cannot transmit marks.
- Genuine causal processes must structurally leave marks which retain over time.
- A process can be causal even if it does not transmit any mark.
- Causal interaction. A causal interaction involves a spatio-temporal intersection between causal processes which changes the structure of both
- CM leaves out causal relationships which exist between properties and magnitude rather than strictly processes and interactions
- Mark transmission may not help us understanding which features of the causal process are causally relevant.
- Generalization about the distribution of a large quantity of interactions -- 'radical abstraction'
- Causal explanation which avoids appeals to counterfactuals
- Causal process: a process which transmits non-zero conserved quantity at each moment in history.

## Mathematical Explanation (SEP)
[Source](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mathematics-explanation/){:target="_blank"}

Mathematical explanations in the natural sciences
- How to understand the appearance of mathematical phenomena in science?
- How to distinguish from the mathematical and physical components of an explanation?
- Dominant accounts of scientici explanation are causal
- What about non-causal explanations?

The explanatory role of mathematics in science: some historical remarks
- How do we obtain scientific knowledge? Through demonstration. 
- Aristotle: of the fact vs of the reasoned fact.
- There are mathematical explanations of physical phenomena
- Can mathematics give explanations of natural phenomena?

Philosophical relevance of mathematical explanations in science
- Unification and explanation often pull in different directions.
- Mathematics, modeling, and idealization
  - Moving away from explanations of mechanical causes, rather, emphasis on mathematical forms.
  - Mathematical formalism helps unify but doesn't really explain the how and why.
  - Asumptotic reasoning -- idealisms. Batterman: ''asymptotic analyses so often provide physical insight is that they illuminate structurally stable aspects of the phenomenon and its governing equations''.
  - Details are ignored, but one still arrives at correct explanations
  - How does math 'hook onto' reality?
  - Optimality models: explain without asserting causal structure
  - Topological explanations

Questions
- Why cannot mathematical facts be explanations?
- If proofs are citing evidence, then why cannot the axioms of our system (theorems) and properties be cited?
- Is there a difference between being explained by [x] and being explained? Can a theory be universally explained?
- Are explanations unique, scientific or mathematic? -- unique, all explanations can be trivially transformed into another.
