## Scientific Explanation (SEP)
[Source](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-explanation/){:target="_blank"}

Background and Introduction
- What is 'scientific explanation'?
  - What is 'scientific' about an explanation?
  - What makes science 'explanatory'?
- It is possible for claims to be true and unexplanatory.
- Description vs explanation. 
- Are all scientific explanations causal?
- Causal vs non-causal explanations

The DN Model
- Deductive-Nomological Model: a scientific explanation has an explanandum and an explanans
  - Explanandum: describing the phenomenon to be explained
  - Expanans: the class of sentences adduced to account for the phenomenon
- The explanation is a sound deductive argument which follows from the explanans (deductive)
- The explanans must have at least one law of nature (essential premise) (nomological)
- What is a law of nature? SOme generalizations are laws and others are accidentally true.
- Generalizations which are laws can explain why... maybe?
- Are laws exceptionless generalizations?
- DN captures explanation via deduction. What about statistical laws?
- Deductive-statistical explanation: deduction of narrower statistical uniformity.
- Inductive-Statistical explanation: explanandum and explanans relationship is inductive
- Which should all or some explanations have DN or IS structure?
- We need to show that the phenomenon resulted from particular circumstances.

> "the essence of scientific explanation can be described as nomic expectabilityâ€”that is expectability on the basis of lawful connections."

- Role of causal claims in scientific explanation: are all explanations causal?
- All causal claims imply some sort of regularity -- law
- Explanations should satisfy the DN/IS model because of the requirement of causal claims.
- DN as necessary vs sufficient conditions for explanations
- Is explanation asymmetric? You can only go in one direction of initial conditions towards an outcome
- A derivation can satisfy DN and still contain irrelivances
- DN does not even state necessary conditions for successful explanation -- maybe.


The SR Model
- Wesley Salmon's statistical relevance model.
- Class/population $$A$$; attribute $$C$$ is statistically relevant to another attribute $$B$$ iff $$P(B \mid A \wedge C) \neq P(B \mid A)$$
- Statistically relevnat properties are explanatory.
