## Introduction to Lectures on the History of Philosophy
- Considering the connection between the past and the present of philosophy.
- History of philosophy is a succession of noble minds who have won for us the treasure of knowledge. (A very idealist view of history, which strikes me given how Marx instrumentalizes it in a materialist view of history.)
- The history of philosophy contrasts with political philosophy: philosophy is the history in which individuals shape and conquer the world.
- In philosophy, thought is free and universal. (In what sense is this a materialist reading of history, materialism in an ideal sense?)
- Acts of thought initially appear to be historically determined. Our existence is histroically dependent. 
- The possession of self-conscious reason did not suddenly come to us, but is a result of labor.
- Accumulation of knowledge: we must find ourselves running in a chain, in a lineage.
- Tradition is not docile but energetic and ferocious 
- The universal Mind grows
- Are the Chinese in historical standstill?
- The soul of a generation is encompassed in its intellectual contributions to the lineage of the mind.
- Page 3 (2): "this material becomes degraded to a material which becomes metamorphosed by Mind."
- To raise knowledge to a higher level.
- History shows us our self-becoming.
- The history of Philosophy provides an introduction to Philosophy itself.
- Becoming is not passive
- What happens when thought is occupied with itself?
- What is the work to which Hegel references on pg. 5 (2500 years)?
- How does the intellectual world have a history when Thought is eternal? True, necessary thought cannot change. 
- But first we must see the woods before the trees.
- History is significant only through its relation to the universal.
- History shows how what appears to belong to mere history is really in the science of Philosophy
  - The history of philosophy is the science of philosophy
- What counts as philosophy? Religion? Mythology? etc.


A. The Notion of the History of Philosophy
- The concept of the history of philosophy contains an inner contradiction. 
  - Philosophy aims at the end of truth.
  - History tells us that what has existed at one time does not exist some other time.
  - Therefore Truth has no history.
  - There is no truth to be found in history.
- Outward history vs history of the subject itself
- Two elements in history:
  - Additions and deviations to formerlye stablished truth
  - Combatting of errors and purification of principles, **return to first simplicity**
  - Absolute and its negation?
- How has philosophy (the doctrine of truth) been so historically *particular*?
  - It has "revealed itself" particularly
- In religion, there is a fixed truth (the inner content) unchangeable in history.
- In the sciences, much is dependent on what is previously known
- In mathematics, history only records further additions
- Philosophy does not show thiese sorts of simple dynamics -- is there progress? Or only repetition?

Common ideas regarding the history of philosophy
- History of philosophy as an accumulation of opinions
  - Common idea that the history of philosophy is the interplay between philosophical opinions -- folks who engage in a "history of senseless follies" -- trivial permutations in the ideal space.
  - It is said that we gain knowledge by learning different opinions of other philosophers.
  - Hegel: this renders philosophy a superfluous science.
  - Opinions are subjective conceptions: uncontrolled ideas. 
  - There is no such thing, hwoever, as a philosophical opinion. 
  - Philosophy is the objective science of truth, not of opinion or spinning out opinions.
  - The opposite of opinion is Truth, in front of which opinion pales.
  - Two oppositions of philosophy
    - piety: reason cannot apprehend what is true and can lead only towards doubt (what is the relation between this and phenomenology?)
    - Reason stands its grounds. But can we even make knowledge through reason? Reason has turned against itself.
  - In theology, it is not so much that the belief of the church *is* Christianity, but that every believer in them holds a conviction of christianity. Thus the drive to know Truth is relinquished. (???) Conviction is an opinion.
  - Opposition between opinion and truth: emergent from the Platonic opposition between opinion and science.
  - Can we supercede the truth?
  - If we claim so, then the hisotry of philosophy is about finding ideas, here and there: my thinking reason is not free, but extraneous, dead historic matter (Plato's objection to writing -- as dead, cold, not living?) (14) -- for Hegel this results in subjective vanity, to look in a mirror and get nowhere.
  - "Truth cannot be known" -- Hegel will investigate this later.
  - If philosophy really is a lineage of opinions, then Hegel finds no meaning in philosophy itself, since each opinion gets us nowhere. 
  - **So what does Hegel say about truth itself?**
- Proof of the futility of philosophy knowledge obtained throught he history of philosophy itself
  - Which version of philosophy should we accept?
  - If there is truth, then that means some of the greatest minds must have erred. 
  - **What does Hegel mean by "This consequence, which ensues from the diversity in philosophical systems, is, as may be supposed, the evil in the matter, while at the same time it is a subjective good?"** (16)
  - If philosophy is a real science, then one philosophy must be true. WHich one is true? Each one asserts its truth. (What is this about evil?)
  - How shall we give judgement at all?
  - "This fact, which cannot be denied, seems to contain the justifi cation, indeed the necessity for applying to Philosophy the words of Christ, " Let the dead bury their dead ; arise, and follow Me." The whole of the history of Philosophy becomes a battlefield covered with the bones of the dead ; it is a kingdom not merely formed of dead and lifeless in dividuals, but of refuted and spiritually dead systems, since each has killed and buried the other"
  - Behold the philosophy by which thine own will be refuted and dispalced shall not tarry long as it has not tarried before.
  - Basically, philosophy runs into this problem of viciousness -- everyone is axeing each other

> "What can be more useless than to learn a string of bald opinions, and what more unimportant?"

- Explanatory remarks on the diversity in philosophies
  - The Truth is one. Reason maintains this. 
  - So must others be true?
  - But each philosophy gives proof to the being of the one and ture philosophy.
  - "This is a common mode of reasoning and is what seems in truth to be the view of sober thought. As regards the sober nature of the word at issue — thought — we can tell from everyday experience that if we fast we feel hunger either at once or very soon. But sober thought always has the fortunate power of not resulting in hunger and desire, but of being and remaining as it is, content. Hence the thought expressed m such an utterance reveals the fact that it is dead understanding; for it is only death which fasts and yet rests satisfied. But neither physical life nor intellectual remains content with mere abstention ; as desire it presses on through hunger and through thirst towards Truth, towards knowledge itself. It presses on to satisfy this desire and does not allow itself to feast and find sufficiency in a reflection such as this." -- what the fuck does he mean? Presses onwards towards truth?
  - The common bond of these philosophies
  - Why disagreement / diversity in the systems of philosophy?
  - Truth and philosophy: not only truth vs error
  - The diversity of philosophy does not prejudice philosophy but actually necessary to philosophy as a science
  - Philosophy is to grasp the truth; it is not that nothing can be known or that only temporal and finite truths can be known.
  - The history of philosophy erquires doing philosophy itself.
  - History is not merely a collection of chance events (denigrates literary efforts bascially)
  - Thinking minds have a real connected rational nature.
  - **We must believe in the spirit of the world!**

Explanatory remarks upon the definition of the history of philosophy
- Truth is only one. This is an abstract and formal claim.
- The aim of philosophy: this Truth is the source of which from all else proceeds.
- All observations lead back to that source.
- A single truth is not merely a solitary, empty thought, but "one determined within itself"
- Development and the Concrete
- The product of thinking is the thought, then notion, and then idea. The idea is Truth. 
- The Idea has a nature, and that is to develop, and that is to comprehend itself, or to become what it is.
- **The idea must make itself what it is -- it is what it is.** (bon foi!)
- The notion of development
  - Philosophy must investigate development, the idea
  - Two states of development: capacity (potentia, bieng-in-itself), actuality (being-for-itself)
  - If man is by nature rational, then the child has capacities, or the actual possibility of reason, as if he does not have reason.
  - WHat is implicit becomes explicit
  - What is the real meaning of the word? In-itself must become for man. Man becomes for himself, and is made double.
  - It is in thought alone that thought is its object; reason produces what is rational, and so reason is its own object.
  - Man, who is himself rational, has not gotten further since he becomes rational for himself. But it is the form of being which matters. 
  - All mankind is naturally rational. Slavery continues: why? Africans and Orientals do not know what is explicit for them and that they are free.
  - All knowledge and learning must turn inwards and become object, for themself.
  - That which is implicit comes into existence, and passes into change
  - The plant does not lose itslef in mere indefinite change. The germ is impelled towards development. But in the end it produces itself alone.
  - Doubling or splitting of the germ: but in the Mind, consciousness is free and unites itself
  - **Question -- to what extent was Hegel the OG Sartre? How does this differ from what Sartre is saying about fundamental freedom and such?**
  - Mind resolves itself and moves forward in a dialectical process.
  - The mind desires to become with itself as its highest goal.
  - Temporality and history is the struggle of the Mind to know itself; that is, to become the object to itself, for it to really become itself. 
  - Is Hegel saying that the mind is constantly striving to be in good faith with itself? To present itself as what it really is?
  - Mind can only attain the freedom of itself with Thought.
  - I am wholly restricted in the material world, but I am rendered free when I cast my ideal superior dimension.
  - Fetishism of rationality
  - How similar is the Hegelian spirit to the Schopenhauerian will?
- The notion of the Concrete
  - What develops and forms the absolute content?
  - Being-in-self and being-for-self are present in action
  - Development forms content, the Idea itself -- unity in the third -- "each is at home with, and not without, itself"
  - Idea is in its content concrete within itself. Firstly, it is concrete potentially; secondly, what is in itself should for it.
  - What is he saying??
  - Science of philosophy deals with abstractions and empty generalities, so goes the objection. 
  - But in fact philosophy is Universal, and True, and therefore it is *within itself* particular
  - **If the Truth is abstract it must be untrue.**
  - Human reason goes out towards the concrete
  - Understanding begins as abstract and impractical, but is antagonistic towards it and leads to the concrete
  - The implicit is always concrete within itself, because it suggests that it will tend towards becoming concrete. 
  - The concrete must become for-itself, or explicit
  - The concrete must differentiate itself from its initial unity. But it holds contradiction within itself and brings distinction into being.

> Life, both that which is in Nature and that which is of the Idea, of Mind within itself, is thus manifested. Were the Idea abstract, it would simply be the highest conceivable existence, and that would be all that could be said of it ; but such a God is the product of the under standing of modern times.

  - What is true is found *in the process* (process philosophy? Whitehead)
  - *There is difference but then it becomes unity (again)?*
  - Each part of the leaf shares all the qualities of the leaf; gold is unseparated and whole.
  - People say that matter must either be continuous or divisible (discrete), but it really is both. Hegel is saying that we can see it either way, and that dualism is the unity.
  - Man is free, or man is determined. But the Mind is concrete, and its attributes are freedom and necessity. The Mind is free in its necessity, and finds its freedom in it alone, since necessity rests on its freedom (26) (wtf?)
  - The activity is a succession of processes in development with a circle returning within itself. 
  - The mind moves back in itself to comprehend itself.
- Philosophy is one idea in totality with internal contradictions arising to grow, extension through intension and vice versa, emanation from the One Idea
  - A kind of idealist conception of the Idea in which it is all powerful and everything is in itself.
  - The Idea is a system of necessity, but that is its *own* necessity, which is the constitution of its freedom.
  - Is this a sort of relativism which doesn't concede that it is relativist? Kind of a "the absolute truth is relativism"?

Results obtained with respect to the notion of the History of Philosophy
- Philosophy is a system ind evelopment
- Nature and Mind are particularizations of the pure Idea
- The history of philosophy is essentially a dialectic, the set of dialectical movements form the Idea
- The history of philosophy is the study of philosophy itslef.
- the business of HP is the business of the Idea
- Science is not a mere collection of facts

## *Phenomenology of the Spirit*

### Preface: On Scientific Cognition
1
- The preface is false as a historical statement
- The preface is not the way to expound philosophical truth
- Philosophy moves towards the universal
- Right now, we do not yet have the subject(-matter)

2
- Defining how a philosophical work fits into a philosophical lineage is "extraneou" and misses what is really important for cognizing the truth.
- One gets fixated on the truth or falsity of a proposition.
- Philosophy is seen as a system of disagreements, rather than a progressive unfolding of truth
- The plant/seed represents an organic unity even though it displaces itself.

3
- Demanding and supplying superfciail explanations for disagreement and such -- creates the impression of hard work without actually doing anything.
- The real issue is not addressed by stating it as an objective, but by doing it; the result is not the whole but the result with the result.
- The aim itself is "lifeless universal"; the aim is a mere drive without actuality
- Differentiating and passing judgement is easy to do
- This sort of work never really gets to the actual issue 
- It remains preoccupied with it.
- To judge a thing with substance is easy, to comprehend it is much harder

4
- Culture emerges from the "immediacy" of "substantial" life and must work up to the general conception of the real issue
- Culture must inscribe within itself the genuinness of life.

5
- Truth can only exist in a scientific system of truth
- Now is the time for philosophy to be raised to the status of a science.

6.
- Truth has only the Notion as the element of its existence -- what does this mean?
- If the True exists in intuition, then what is required is the *opposite* of the Notion, because if we could just intuit then we could immediately know/have it.

7
- Spirit has overcome the immediacy of faith and substantialism
- In fact it has gone all the way to unsubstantialism
- It becomes conscious of its loss and its finitude
- Philosophy must meet the need of Spirit to understand itself.
- ...but has improperly done so by restoring the feeling of essential being -- providing edification rather than insight.

8 
- A frenzied effrot to tear individuals from their sensuous being to look at the divine and the absolute
- Attention has been put towards "experience"
- The Spirit is parched for some feeling of the divine

9
> Philosophy must beware of the wish to be edifying.

10
- A false claim that "rapturous haziness is superior to Science"
- A defense of idealism essentially: against the disdain at determinateness
- The objection is totally superficial
- Non-conceptual, substantial knowledge hides the truth from itself -- it surrenders itself to its own contingency, it is totally uncontrolled. They imagine that they can draw a veil over elf-consciousness.
- They receive in their sleep not the wisdom of God but dreams (Freud?)
- Veil of ignorance -- literally Rawls
