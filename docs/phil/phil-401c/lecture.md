## Week 1 Wednesday
- Game thoery - study of strategic interactions between multiple DMs, almost anything counts as a game.
- Descriptive GT - is; Normative GT - ought.
- Equilibrium concepts - used to characterize how agents interact or should interact.
- Ultimatum game $$\in$$ bargaining game - dividing resources. 
- Subgame perfect equilibrium of the ultimatum game - proposal offers lowest possible amount of money and the second accepts.
- What happens when players carry about things other than money?
- Theories of individual rationality and how it can transfer to group decision-making.
- Check participation instructions.
- In the decision matrix:
  - Actions - row headers, what is within the DM's control.
  - States - column headers, states of the world, what is not within the DM's control.
  - Outcomes - cells in the matrix; represent the result of performing an action at a state.
- We assume a DM has preferences over the outcome space.
- Can you attach numbers to preferences to preserve ordering? Philosophically, this should give us pause. 
- One act dominates another if it is preferable in all states of the world.
- Weak dominance - an action weakly dominates another if it is preferred to the other in at least one state and not dispreferred in any state.
- Principle of strict/weak dominance - it is irrational to perform a strictly/weakly dominated action.
- Act-State Dependence - the decision maker can influence the chance of various states coming true. If the decision matrix does not have act-state independence, we can end up with bizarre results (e.g. party or study with pass or fail states)

## Week 2 Monday
- Decisions under ignorance - ignorance of objective probabilities.
- What is objective probability?
- What is the probability of a nonrepeatable event?
- What rules can you derive without assigning objective states?
- Maximin - pick the action with the maximum minimal outcome. A pessimistic position.
- Minimax regret - find the decision with the minimum maximum regret - weight
- Principle of insffucueitnr easoning, optimism-pessk9m ri;ze - wait undethe frture/
- Optimism-Pessimism - choose the action which maximizes the weighted average.
  - How to understand alpha? Heuristic for weighting cases, don't think about it past abstraction.
- Principle of Indifference - equally indifferent/unknown certainties are treated as equal.
- 

Discussion
- How do disentangle state from action? Can write using conditional statements.
