## *An Introduction to Decision Theory*, Martin Peterson

### Chapter 1: Introduction

- Decision theory: the theory of rational decision making.
- A decision maker choses from a choice space; the outcome depends on the true state of the world, which is often only partially accessible to the decision maker.
- Decision matrix: the result of taking different actions in the action space in combination with certain environmental results.

- Normative theory - how people should make decisions under rational assumptions. This book focuses on normative theory, which is of particular philosophical interest.
