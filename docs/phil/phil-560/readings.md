## "Two Concepts of Intertheoretic Reduction", Thomas Nickles

- Two different kinds of reduction: Nagel's (explanation of one theory by another) and a new proposed one (a "varied collection of intertheoretic relations")

Two Concepts of Reduction
- Does classical mechanics (CM) reduce to special theory of relativity (STR) or vice versa?
- It is in fact not clear.
- The more general STR reduces to the less general CM in the limit of low velocities
- So what exactly does 'reduce to' mean?
- Reduction 1: "an increase in the overall efficiency of a conceptual scheme" -- "elimination, trimming down, consolidation"
- But what about 'historical reduction' and predecessors?
- "Reduction 2": taking a limit on something, extracting a property
- Consolidating logically superfluous postulates is part of Reduction 1, derivational reduction. The reduced theory must be a logical consequence of the reducing theory. (!!!)
- For Reduction 2, not all reduction is explanation. Guided by special cases or relations
- Reduction 2 paradigms are 'domain-preserving' reductions of successor theories to predecessors
- Reduction may provide confirmation of a new theory and establish its importance
- There can many ways to reduce-2, whereas only one to reduce-1
- For reduction-2, the reduced theory does not need to be logically compatible with the reducing theory
- Reduction-2 is not so sentiive to meaning change, overcomes Nagel's objections

Nagel on Reduction-1
- Distinction of homogenous and heterogenous reduction
    - Homogenous: descriptive vocab of a reduced theory is a subset of the descriptive vocab of the reducing theory
    - Heterogenous: reduced theory contains descriptive terms not in the reducing theory
    - Nagel wants to turn heterogenous reduction into homogenous reduction
    - T1 reduces T2 when T2 is derivable from T1 (T2 is reduced)
- Domain-combining reductions are heterogenous
- Historically distinct domains involve different descriptive vocabs
- "Meaning change" objection: passing from one theory system to another involves an extensive conceptual shift -- e.g. 'mass' in CM vs. STR
    - Fallacy of equivocation?
- Can we apply bridge laws? Would turn homogenous reductions into heterogenous ones
- Feyerabend: reduced and reducing theoreis are almost always logically incompatible; reductions are only approximate
- Partial reduction? Derivational reduction?
- Nagel's critics forget that philosophical models are deliberately idealized
- *Many* claimed reduction-1s fail because of logical incompatibilities.
- Nagel;'s condition are not necessar fro all types of intertheoretic reduction
- However, correlation is not enough for reduction

Identificatory Reduction
- Sklar and Schnaffer: importance of theoretical identifiation in reduction
- Nagel's corollary laws are too weak

## "The Reduction of Theories" from *The Structure of Science*, Earnest Nagel

- Classical mechanics is no longer regarded as the universal / fundamental science of nature
- Many physicists are skeptical if you can have a theory which integrates all natural science into a common set of principles.
- Recurrent feature of modern science: absorbption by or reduction to a more inclusive theory
- Findings of physics are often incompatible with 'common sense'
- The 'bankruptcy' of classical physics
- What are the conditions for reduction?

I. The Reduction of Thermodynamics to Statistical Mechanics

- Reduction -- explanation o a theory established in one area of inquiry by another theory
- 
- "Secondary science" -- reducing theory
- "Primary science" reduced theory
- A theory applying to a specific set of things may expand its domain.
    - Mechanics moved from point-masses to deformable bodies
    - Extension from Galileo's laws to Newtonian mechanics and gravitational theory -- no new concepts
- Reductions of this type establish deductive relaitons between homogenous vocabularies -- these are accepted as normal phases
- A second kind of reduction: assimilation into a distinct theory
    - Primary science wipes out familiar distinctions as spurious, maintains that some prima facie different traits are really identical, etc.
    - Often happens when the secondary science is macropscopic and the primary science is a microscopic constitution for macroscopic processes.
    - Change in knowledge of what 'temperature' is -- from a feeling to the temperature to the mean kinetic energy of molecules
    - What is the genuine reality?
- Is temperature an 'emergent' trait, manifesting at higher levels of nature but not at lower levels?
- "Heterogenous" reductions
- Example of reduction with thermodynamics with mechanics (statistical mechanics)
    1. Thermal phenomena goes back to modern times to Galileo
    2. Laws have systematic interrelations
    3. Thermodynamics: uses concepts, distinctions, general laws also employed in mechanics, but also adds notions like temperature, heat, and entropy
    4. How to find a more intimate connection between thermal and mechanical phenomena?
    5. Introduction of a statistical assumption

II. Formal Conditions for Reduction
- Axioms, special hypotheses, and experimental laws must be available as explicitly formulated statements
- Four classes of statements under a science $$S$$:
    1. Theoretical postulates of $$S$$ and the theorems derivable from them, as well as coordinating definitions
    2. Experimental laws
    3. Observation statements
    4. Borrowed laws
- Every statement of a science can be understood as a linguistic structure
    - There will always be a set of primitive expressions
    - Observable expressions / primitives
    - Theoretical expressions / primitives
- Primary and secondary sciences often have expressions with the same meanings
- Reduction happens when the experimental laws of a secondary science are logical consequences of theoretical assumptions of a primary science.
- Two formal conditions for reduction of a primary science to a primary science
    1. Assumptions must be introduced into the primary science to explain what "A" (from the secondary science) means
    2. All laws of the secondary science (including 'A") must be logically derivable from the primary theory
- Three possibilities for linkages:
    1. Logical connections -- 'A' in secondary science is entailed by 'B' in primary science
    2. Linkages are conventions, experimental significance is assigned
    3. Linkages are factual or material
- To reduce thermodynamics to mechanics, you have to connect temperature to mean kinetic energy of gas molecules
    - To reduce thermodynamics to mechanics, you have to assert that it is proportional to the mean kinetic energy of gas molecules
    - "Similar syntactical structural" derivable, but there is a different form

III. Nonformal Conditions for Reduction
- Two formal conditions do not distinguish trivial from notewrothy scientific achievements
    - The sole requirement for reduction being logical deducation can be satisfied very easily
    - Extrapolation of theory required
- The reduction of thermodynamics to the kinetic theory of gases gives us much more than the deduction of Boyle-Charles' law -- the reduction is a significant scientific accomplishment
    - We can deduce from the primary theory more complex assumptions
- It is not enough for the previously established laws of a secondary science to be represented in the primary discipline -- the theory must also give useful suggestions for developing the secondary science
- A number of experimental laws seem to have an invariant -- so the reduction of thermodynamics to kinetic theory also integrates laws so that directly relevant evidence for one law can be indirect evidence for others
- Perhaps little to no new knowledge or increased power is gained by reducing one science to another -- it in fact might be counterproductive
- Sciences have a history
- Reducability of one science to another is contingent upon the specific theory employed by a discipline at some time. 
- Psychology an "autonomous discipline" because "a headache is not a rearrangemen tof particles in the cranium", or the mind and physical processes.
- Mistaken notion: the question of if a science is reducible to another is based on inspecting properites or natures of things rather than logical consequences
    - Deducing certain properties from other 'natures' -- turns a logical / empricial question into a speculative and irresolvable one. (365)
- "Laplace in error" -- the Divine Intelligence
- Reduction does not wipeout distinctions recognized by the secondary science. 
    - Reduction is not a process of elimination
    - Headaches explained by physical, chemical, physiological headaches. 
    - States conditions under which a determinate psychological phenomenon takes place.

IV. The Doctrine of Emergence
- Doctrine of 'emergent evolution' or 'holism'
- Emergence of properties at 'higher' levels of organization which are not predictable from properties at lower levels
- The interaction of elements may enter into relations with each other which are different from existing relations.
- "Complete knowledge" on the lements of $$O$$: we know all the propertie sht elements possess in isolation, and all the properties exhibited by complexes other than $$O$$.
- Two cases
    1. Possible to predict if elements will occur in a relation, and what objects will be formed
    2. There is a property such that it is impossible to predict if the element stand in known relation, if an object will be formed. This object is an 'emergent object' and the property is the 'emergent property'
- "most of the chemical and physical properties of water have little known connection, either quanitative or qualitative, with those of oxygen and hydrogen"
- Howwever, Nagel thinks this is not true. It is impossible to deduce properties of water from properties of hydrogen alone or of oxygen alone -- but it is also impossible to deduce the behavior of a clock merely from the organization of its constituent parts
    - It is not properties, but statements which can be deduced
    - Statemetns about complex wholes can be deduced from statements about constitutents if premises contain a suitable theory -- you have to give the terms to be able ot articulate something
- A given property is clearly emergent if it is possessed relative to one theory but not in another theory.
- Emergence: stating certain logical facts about formal relations between statements
- We cannot appeal to 'inherent natures'
- Atomic theory of matter revived by Dalton to account systematiclaly for a range of chemical facts
    - Dalton posited few properties of atoms and could not explain many chemical transformations, but was modified to account for them. 
    - Development of a notion of the 'intrinsic' nature of atoms -- there is a shifting notion of the 'nature' of the atom in each case, from Democritus to Dalton to pysiochemcial theory 
- We should not think that different atomic theories represent progress towards a fixed set of submicroscopic objects -- the notion that atoms have 'inehrent natures' independent of any particular theory is false
- It is not possible to assert what can be predicted from the 'natures' of atomic particles independent of any particular atomic theory
- Properties of compounds can be predicted from current electronic theory of composition of atoms
- Propertie smay be emergent wrt some theory but not another.
- It is also wrong to maintain that we are "baptizing our ignorance" by characterizing a trait as emergent. Our ignorance or incomplete knowledge of the natures of atoms is irrelevant to the issue at stake. 
- The doctrine of emergence is correct as a logical relation between statements.
- Opposition to mechanical reductionists: if some properties are emergent, their occurrence is inexplicable in mechanical terms. Emergence sets limits to the science of mechanics
- "Predicted from" -- deductive or inductive?
- Qualities, structures, modes of behavior come into existence from time to time
- What is a 'different' property or arrangement?
- It is not just that our knowledge of the structures of events change, but that the structures change themselves
- Creation of new substances by chemists which have never existed before: is this a 'realization of potentialities' or something more. 

V. Wholes, Sums, and Organic Unities
- "Organic unities" -- not merely aggregates but "the whole is more than the sum of its parts"
- What is the cognitive worth of these notions of 'whole', 'sum', etc.?
- 'Whole' -- spatial extension, 'part' -- spatially included in it
- 'Whole": temporal period
- 'Whole': -- aggregate of elements
- 'Whole': patterns of relations
- ...
- Sums are not so easily understood
- "The different actions of a chemical compound will never be found to be the sums of actions of its separate parts"
- Relative to classical kinetic theory the thermal properties of solids are not sums of the properties of their parts, but relative to quantum theory properties are their sums
- "Organic / functional" wholes: the behavior is not determined by individual elements, but where part-processes are determined by the intrinsic nature of the whole. Parts do not act independently of each other, but are all related.
    - e.g. the distribution of charges on a conductor
- Piecewise construction vs analysis
- Additive and nonadditive analysis -- particle physics of classical mechanics vs field approach of electrodynamics.
- Some wholes can be analyzed in this manner, for others it still has to be worked out.
