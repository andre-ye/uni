## "Two Concepts of Intertheoretic Reduction", Thomas Nickles

- Two different kinds of reduction: Nagel's (explanation of one theory by another) and a new proposed one (a "varied collection of intertheoretic relations")

Two Concepts of Reduction
- Does classical mechanics (CM) reduce to special theory of relativity (STR) or vice versa?
- It is in fact not clear.
- The more general STR reduces to the less general CM in the limit of low velocities
- So what exactly does 'reduce to' mean?
- Reduction 1: "an increase in the overall efficiency of a conceptual scheme" -- "elimination, trimming down, consolidation"
- But what about 'historical reduction' and predecessors?
- "Reduction 2": taking a limit on something, extracting a property
- Consolidating logically superfluous postulates is part of Reduction 1, derivational reduction. The reduced theory must be a logical consequence of the reducing theory. (!!!)
- For Reduction 2, not all reduction is explanation. Guided by special cases or relations
- Reduction 2 paradigms are 'domain-preserving' reductions of successor theories to predecessors
- Reduction may provide confirmation of a new theory and establish its importance
- There can many ways to reduce-2, whereas only one to reduce-1
- For reduction-2, the reduced theory does not need to be logically compatible with the reducing theory
- Reduction-2 is not so sentiive to meaning change, overcomes Nagel's objections

Nagel on Reduction-1
- Distinction of homogenous and heterogenous reduction
    - Homogenous: descriptive vocab of a reduced theory is a subset of the descriptive vocab of the reducing theory
    - Heterogenous: reduced theory contains descriptive terms not in the reducing theory
    - Nagel wants to turn heterogenous reduction into homogenous reduction
    - T1 reduces T2 when T2 is derivable from T1 (T2 is reduced)
- Domain-combining reductions are heterogenous
- Historically distinct domains involve different descriptive vocabs
- "Meaning change" objection: passing from one theory system to another involves an extensive conceptual shift -- e.g. 'mass' in CM vs. STR
    - Fallacy of equivocation?
- Can we apply bridge laws? Would turn homogenous reductions into heterogenous ones
- Feyerabend: reduced and reducing theoreis are almost always logically incompatible; reductions are only approximate
- Partial reduction? Derivational reduction?
- Nagel's critics forget that philosophical models are deliberately idealized
- *Many* claimed reduction-1s fail because of logical incompatibilities.
- Nagel;'s condition are not necessar fro all types of intertheoretic reduction
- However, correlation is not enough for reduction

Identificatory Reduction
- Sklar and Schnaffer: importance of theoretical identifiation in reduction
- Nagel's corollary laws are too weak

## "The Reduction of Theories" from *The Structure of Science*, Earnest Nagel

- Classical mechanics is no longer regarded as the universal / fundamental science of nature
- Many physicists are skeptical if you can have a theory which integrates all natural science into a common set of principles.
- Recurrent feature of modern science: absorbption by or reduction to a more inclusive theory
- Findings of physics are often incompatible with 'common sense'
- The 'bankruptcy' of classical physics
- What are the conditions for reduction?

I. The Reduction of Thermodynamics to Statistical Mechanics

- Reduction -- explanation o a theory established in one area of inquiry by another theory
- 
- "Secondary science" -- reducing theory
- "Primary science" reduced theory
- A theory applying to a specific set of things may expand its domain.
    - Mechanics moved from point-masses to deformable bodies
    - Extension from Galileo's laws to Newtonian mechanics and gravitational theory -- no new concepts
- Reductions of this type establish deductive relaitons between homogenous vocabularies -- these are accepted as normal phases
- A second kind of reduction: assimilation into a distinct theory
    - Primary science wipes out familiar distinctions as spurious, maintains that some prima facie different traits are really identical, etc.
    - Often happens when the secondary science is macropscopic and the primary science is a microscopic constitution for macroscopic processes.
    - Change in knowledge of what 'temperature' is -- from a feeling to the temperature to the mean kinetic energy of molecules
    - What is the genuine reality?
- Is temperature an 'emergent' trait, manifesting at higher levels of nature but not at lower levels?
- "Heterogenous" reductions
- Example of reduction with thermodynamics with mechanics (statistical mechanics)
    1. Thermal phenomena goes back to modern times to Galileo
    2. Laws have systematic interrelations
    3. Thermodynamics: uses concepts, distinctions, general laws also employed in mechanics, but also adds notions like temperature, heat, and entropy
    4. How to find a more intimate connection between thermal and mechanical phenomena?
    5. Introduction of a statistical assumption

II. Formal Conditions for Reduction
- Axioms, special hypotheses, and experimental laws must be available as explicitly formulated statements
- Four classes of statements under a science $$S$$:
    1. Theoretical postulates of $$S$$ and the theorems derivable from them, as well as coordinating definitions
    2. Experimental laws
    3. Observation statements
    4. Borrowed laws
- Every statement of a science can be understood as a linguistic structure
    - There will always be a set of primitive expressions
    - Observable expressions / primitives
    - Theoretical expressions / primitives
