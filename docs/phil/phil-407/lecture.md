## Lecture 1: What is Justice?
- We are reading from a very particular tradition of Western political philsophy, for good or for ill
- At least potentially a difference between moral and political justice; doing what is moral and what is politically right; can come into tension
- Is justice real? What does it mean to say that justice is real? Or is justice a convention, what we came together to decide what is real or not?
    - Maybe it is a real convention?
    - Or is there a natural/supernatural thing we call justice?
    - Maybe justice comes from God?
- Is there a pre-political thing?
- Maybe there is no property in the pre-political, there is no structure which says that this belongs to you or me
- Distinction between political and moral, convention and nature, and the pre-political.

Pre-Socratic Thought
- Heraclitus -- 540-480 BCE
    - You never step in the same river twice -- things are always changing
    - Reality is constant change; stability is fake; you get the idea of stability because of the unity of opposites -- opposite forces cancel each other out
- Parmenides
    - Reality is one
    - Reality is fixed and eternal, and in fact change and motion are the illusion.
- Sophists of ancient Athens -- both sides of an argument can be rationally defended
    - Distinction between phusis (nature) and convention (nomos)
    - All socia adn political affairs are in the realm of hte nomos and might even go against phusis; this is the real source of freedom.
    - The fact that you can curb things in our human nature shows us that we are free, the source of freedom. 
    - Sophists made a lot of money in Athens
    - Socrates was the anti-Sophist, hated the sophists
    - Sophists emphasized the ability to persuade and motivate
    - Is the ability to persuade or motivate others the same as obtaining truth (justice)?
    - Truth, to the sophists, was artificial and context-dependent
- Plato -- 427-347 BCE
    - Plato disagreed with the sophists
    - Plato comes from an elite aristocratic family
    - Student of Socrates; Socrates is executed for corrupting the youth
    - 530 people in the jury
    - Plato thinks that democracy is bad; democracy starts wars with Sparta; when Sparta puts in people that can manage the state, it is democracy that overthrows them and kills in Socrates
    - Realism: truth exists independent of us. Sophists are wrong -- democracy creates people who are easily persuaded, not people who follow the truth.
- Plato, the Divided Line -- Plato's claim to fame through the mouth of Socrates
    - The physical world of senses: Heroclitus is write. All you have is constant change.
    - But when you reason, you have the invisible world of reason, a stability here -- Parmenides is right. Brings them together.
    - As you move from each level, you get closer to the truth: conjecture, belief, understanding, knowledge/science
    - You have an idea of what a chair is
- Plato's allegory of the cave -- metaphysical and political at the same time
    - Most people are chained in the empirical world, looking at shadows on the wall
    - The man escapes the cave and sees the real realm of forms, the higher realm -- you see the sun, the sun is the cause of everything and the form of the good
    - What happens if you try to tell people in the cave about the outside world? People kill you. Socrates, case en point.
- Tripartite soul
    - Greeks are about character -- usually it's about ethics -- do you have good character? You will do the right thing when presented with certain ethical quandaries. For Plato, you must have a balanced soul.
    - Moral pyschology of Plato: appetites (physical desires), spirited (emotional), rational (logical)
        - Does this map onto Freud's id, ego, superego?
    - Exact symmetry with government
        - Worker / appetite
        - SOldier / courage
        - King / reason
- *The Republic*
    - A lot of political philosophy is done via hte idea that things can be different
    - Peace of Nicias (421 BCE); Republic written in 380, 40 years after; Democracy restored to Athens in 403
    - Peace of Nicias -- the war might end, things might end, etc.
    - We start with a descent. The higher we go, the closer we get to truth and knowledge.
    - Start from the common view and work up.
    - When you read *The Republic*, pay attention to the ascending and the descending. The philosopher must always return back tot eh cave. 
    - Cephalous -- first definition of justice. Depicted as an old traditionalist: Speak the truth adn give back what one has taken from another. Social contract view of justice. Plato thinks this is a bad form of justice. The shadows are real, but they're not the real thing. Easy arguments against relativism
    - Polemarchus -- Do good to your friends and harm to your enemies. Isn't justice supposed to make things better? HOw can we harm in service of justice
    - Thrasymachus -- the sophist. Only time that Socrates is scared. Justice is simplyt he advantage of the stronger. Injustice is a virtue, justice is vice. Politics is really a game of power and domination; the winners write history and make laws. 
    - Nietzsche as Thrasymachus -- revolt against Christian morality. Cephalous and Polemarchus agree that justice is a virtue and injustice is a vice.

St. Augustine -- 354-430 CE
- Brought together Platonism and Catholicism
- Christ leaves the cave and comes back
- Two worlds view: intelliglbe world of heaven and the sensible material world
- Render unto Cesar what is Cesar's and God what is God's
- Government is inherenntlyc orrupt, necessarily because of original sin.

St. Thomas Aquinas -- 1225-1274
- Reintroduces Aristotle into the West
- Eternal Law: God's mind
- Natural Law: to find out what is in God's mind through reason
- Positive Law: law that is promulgated by an authority
- Scholasticism: Bible + Aristotle

Niccolo Machiavelli -- 1469-1527
- Modern period
- Voyages and conquest
- Luther for Christianity, the 99 theses
- Bacon and the scientific method -- the way you find out truth is not by trying to find it through its pristine state but by changing things and seeing what it does
- Machiavelli: I can do for politics what Copernicus did for astronomy, turn it into a kind of science
- Had a long history in foreign and military affairs
- What if Thrasymachus responded to Plato? Thrasymachus just leaves in Book 1.
- Machiavelli is tortured and exiled
- Amoral realism: who cares! What you do is to study historical cases and draw conclusiosn for effective tactics. 
- St. Augustine: there is no morality in politics, you are trying to affect certain things

Social Contract Theory
- Social contracts: 
    - Hobbes: security
    - Locke: liberty, we are born in the image of God, we need a government which will protect our liberty
    - Rosseau: equality, what you should care about is equality. Inequality creates instability and insecurity; economic domination is the worst form of tyranny. General will is of equality.
    - Hume: this is a fiction, there was never a social contract -- every regime is the product of conquest and domination, and you just get used to it -- that's how you get stability. If you want change, it has to be slow
- The Security question: metaphor of war, how do we avoid a state of war? And if we find ourselves in war, what do we do?
- The Liberty question: metaphor of slavery, what does it means to be a slave (dominated)? How dow e avoid this cnodition of domination?

Thomas Hobbes -- 1588-1679 -- and Social Contract History
- Hobbes was infleunced by the English Civil War, the 30 years war, the Peace of Westphalia, Enlightenment commitments to science and reason
- Thirty Years War, 1618 and 1648
    - Religious wars are about establishing the superioority of one religion over another -- submit, convert, or die. **War becomes conventional foreign policy.**
- Peace of Westphalia 1648. Ends 30 years of war.
    - Ends universal ambitions of the Holy Roman Empire
    - Establishes the nation-state system, states are the highest authorities -- you don't go to the pope, the head of state determines the religion of the state. A model for how to end really nasty wars.
- English Civil War, 1642 -- 1651
    - Parliamentarians vs the Royalists
    - James the 1st unites Scotland and England in 1603, but dies in 1625
    - Charles the 1st takes over but married a Catholic French princess, Henrietta Maria
    - Kingdom is split on the idea of absolute monarchy; the nobility like it because it keeps them in power, poor folks don't like it as much.
    - Merchants (what become the bourgeoisie) want more ppower
    - 1628, the Petition of Right: Parliament controls taxes. Charles just stops calling Parliament into session.
    - Sctoland invades English over Anglican vs Puritan dispute.
    - Republic -- government with checks on power, usually a democracy, but there are other bodies too
    - Charles is captured and executed; Oliver Cromwell acts like a king but dies
- Sir Robert Filmer -- 1588 - 1653: argued for the Divine Right of Kings. The right of kings to rule ogoes back to the Biblical Adam. It is impossible for people to give the alws to themselves. Uses the analogy of the nuclear family, where the father is the source of the law
- Aristotle -- 384 - 322 BCE, ancient Greek view of nature, justice is living in accordance with nature and living against nature turns us into monsters. **What is moral is natural**. The legal/political should reflect morality
    - To do the moral thing is to do what is natural
    - Lgal and political structure should reflect the moral
- St. Augustine -- nature is sin, nature is corrupt and will corrupt you; we fell from grace; salvation must be found in the supernatural.
- Henry Parker, 1606 to 1652
    - Parliamentarians are right in the English Civil War
    - Relationship between the king and the people is contractural and not natural
    - The people form a corporate body which makes a compact with the ruler
    - The contract is aimed to provide security and freedom of the subjects
- Francis Bacon, 1562 -- 1626
    - Distinctively modern in their appeal to Bacon: nature is basically a complicated machine. You have to understand which strings to pull, nothing super special about it.
- Thomas Hobbes' account
    1. The world of politics is a world of artifice.
        - What the parliamentarians say is right.
        - Artifice -- artificial, convention, made up (nomos)
        - We make the political order ourselves, not natural nor supernatural
    2. A republic is not viable (you can't have checks on power)
        - The monarchists are right
        - Without absolute government, you have chaos.
    3. War is destructive.
        - Machiavellians are wrong
        - Scheming and power accumulation is not the end goal
        - Peace is the whole aspiration of politics
        - *The Leviathan*
- We do not naturally come to form politicla institutions. Nature is not conducive to human flourishing. 
- People are not by nature evil (St. Augustine), but they also are not very good to each other.
- Hobbes: wants to break everything down into its basic parts. Find individuals bumping into each other, despite being individuated
- The state of nature -- what are people like
    - without authority and without social ties and traditions
    - individuated, but not isolated from each other
    - extension of the scientific method
- No one has natural authority over anyone in the state of nature
    - Equality in strength: we can all kill each other -- for Hobbes, there is no morality in the state of nature. In the Hobbesian prepolitical realm, there is no one to tell you what is right and wrong. Hobbes is an athiest, he does not believe in God. Morality comes from authority. There is no morality until we come together to establish it.
    - Equality in mind: we can all outsmart each other in at least one thing
    - Hobbes: this is not good! Including your body...
- Hobbes tries to invite laws: conserve yourself! etc. the state of nature is not good. 
- Even you, the hunkiest guy, will not dominate strength -- even you have to sleep. Even you will need to be vulnerable. You can't outclever everyone -- you can always outsmart someone in one thing. Hobbes is scared of everything. 
- The Hobbesian state of nature: "a world of continual fear, and danger of violent death, and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short."
- The state of nature is a state of war. Any time you are in a state of nature, you are in a state of war -- not that you are actually fighting, but the threat of perpetual attack and death. The puzzle: how do we create as tate?
- Only by giving up our power to one authority.
- The Leviathan is all of us -- we are the Leviathan altogether.
- Hobbes -- the commonwealth cannot just be nice, you must be in awe such that you respect the laws.
- Hobbes -- you might even be obligated not to allow the state to put you to death quietly

The Gloarious Revolution, 1688-1689
- We all hate Catholics
- John Locke, involved in an assassination of both King Charles 2nd and his brother James. Has to leave England when it leaves

John Locke, 1632-1704
- Locke is the philosopher of the Glorious Revolution
- Locke is worried about slavery: what you need to care about is not security, but liberty / freedom. This is what Hobbes misses. Most of us are unwilling to give up most or all of our freedom for security.
- For Locke, there is morality in the prepolitical. 
- The state of nature is neutral, we don't really run into each other that much -- for Hobbes you run into people all the time. Locke, in the real state of nature, you don't really see people. the only reason you would leave is to preserve freedom (like private property)
- You get private property by mixing your labor with something. This is prepolitical, it comes without a politics.
- Locke: agrees with Hobbes in that the state of nature is valid; the state of nature is not political.
    - What kinds of thought experiments are we doing? A very modern conception, breaking things down to the core elements
- Disagrees with Hobbes: the state of nautre is (not) a state of war; the sovereign does not need to be given absolute and arbitrary power, you don't need absolute power to have some level of power
- Life, liberty, and property
- With Hobbes, we seek peace; with Locke, we preserve peace. 

Jean-Jacques Rosseau, 1712 -- 1778
- "A Discourse on the Moral Effects of the Arts and Sciences"
- "has the restoration of the sciences and arts contributed to the purification of morals?"
- Arts and sicences have only corrupted human morality: civilization is one of the worst things which have happened to human beings.
- If we could go back to the state of nature, we would be great -- an active life, eating, getting along. Even Aristotle wants to talk about language as distinguishing humans, but huamsn would have gone nowhere without sympathy. It is society which beats sympathy outside of you.
- Hobbes -- a social construction aspect, morality is socially constructed. 
- Rosseau does a Hobbes and Hobbes, you didn't go far enough -- all of thesese desires and such you think are natural, are all socially constructed; the state of nature wasn't a bad place for humans. 

> "The philosophers who have exmamined the foundations of society have all felt the necesstiy of returning to the state of nature, but none of them has reached it."

- Convince people how bad the state of nautre is, arm them against each other, make their possessions as burdensome as their needs
- The contract of subjugation: let us unite in order to protect the weak from oppression, restrain the ambitious, and assure everyone of possessing what belongs to him.
- You get the Hobbesian / Lockean contract from an extreme inequality emerging from this devolving of the state of nature, and you bake in this inequality. You were born free but everywhere in chains.

David Hume, 1711 - 1776
- Hume: undermine excessive metaphysical and epistemological views
- The state of nature shows you which values you think are important for justice: security, liberty, or equality (Rosseau).
- We take so much philosophical baggage with us trying to  arrive at ultimate principles, but the best you'll get at are principles of human nature 
- A mitigated skeptic (not Cartesian) -- there are limits on what human reason can know
- Reason is the slave to the passions, what you do is you instill good habits, becuase most people act out of habit
- Hume's political aim: quell political factionalism (Torys, divien right; Whigs, parliamentarians)
- Social contract theory has no basis in historical fact; governments are based on conquest, why would we believe that political legitimacy is based on universal reason.

## Lecture 2: Deontology vs Consequentialism

Immanuel Kant, 1724 - 1804
- The hero of deontology
- Kant: one major failing of all previous moral theories is that they are grounded on something external to the will -- e.g. happiness, divine perfection, instincts, etc.
    - These are all heteronomy -- you are not the author of your own moral law
- Autonomy -- favored by Kant, opposite of heteronomy
- What we want is a moral theory where we give the laws to ourselves; consequences ofactions are irrelevant to morality
- Morality is concerned only with the shining diamond, a good will
- On Hume's account, people are driven to act solely by heteronomyous impulses (sentiments and tradition) -- Hume says that weare driven by our emotions, and reason is a slave to the passions; reason is just calculation
- How do I best get to these things? Reason becomes a slave to the passions. -- Hume
- Kant, something has gone wrong. This would make morality and justice impossible. You cannot have these things if youa re driven by your sentiment.
- **For Kant, morality and justice are only possible if individuals are free to act in accordance with principles of reason and not driven to action by heteronymous impulses.** You have to be free to have done otherwise.
- *pace* -- 'peace be with', in contradiction with
- In order to have morality and justice, persons must be both rational and free.
- Kant is concerned with cause and effect. Hume denies the rational justification of causality. 
- In the phenomenal world, causality reigns; in the noumenal, where things are themselves, we don't know -- but this is where freedom exists.
- Can you hold someone morally responsible if they could not have done otherwise.
- We have to find morality in freedom.
- Three propositions of morality
    - In order for an action to have moral worth it must be done from duty
        - Just having acted in the correct manner is not enough to call an action a moral act.
    - An action from duty has its moral worth not in the purpose to be attained by it but in the maxim in accordance with which the action is decided upon: morality of action is based on the principle and not the effects it has. 
        - Stealing is wrong because it is wrong and not because it has bad effects
    - ...
- Human will -- has ends, it has intentions -- not merely reactive.
- Problems: there are no unquestionable examples of people who act strictly out of duty
- Imperatives: commands of the will.  Imperatives are either hypothetical or categorical. 
    - Hypothetical imperatives: means to an ends. If you want to get to the store, you must take the bus.
    - Categorical imperatives: commands of reason, not of the will. You must not steal. They are done for themselves. Comes from the thing itself. The lifeguard ought to save drowning children, because that is part of being a lifeguard itself.
- Moral imperatives must be categorical imperatives.; morality is based on categorical imperatives
- First formulation of the categorical imperative: "act only ina ccordance with that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it become a universal law." Ask yourself, could that maxim become universal law? Must be applicable to all rational beings and not in contradiction with itself.
- Question -- how are these duties different from something like Aristotelian virtue ethics.
- Two kinds of ends: subjective (ends of hypothetical imperatives, conditional) and objective (ends of categorical imperatives, unconditional and absolute)
- Second formulation: "act that you use humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means"
- Rational nature is distinguihsed from the rest of nature by the fact that we set ends for ourselves.
- Hypothetical imperative: Do not torture animals because you will go on to torture humans / be a bad person.
- Kant is one of the founders of race -- race can justify slavery, different rationalities.
- The end-in-itself is rational nature; an ability to set ends for itself
- Respect for dignity is epitomized in a 'kingdom of ends'
- Kant is starting to think that it's not just our family members, mebmers of our nation, etc. -- but all humans have dignity.
    - Kingdom of ends -- a limitation of each person's freedom so that it is compatible with the freedom of everyone, insofar as this is possible in accord with a universal law. 
    - Reason, freedom, and moral accountability are intimately related.
    - To rule in a way in which a parent controls this child is despotism. 
- Coming to the age of reason -- Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-imposed immaturity. Immaturity is the inability to use one's understanding without guidance from another. This immaturity is self-imposed when its cause lies not in lack of understanding, but in lack of resolve and courage to use it without guidance from another."
- Third formulation: act in accordance with maxims that can at the same time have as their object themselves as universal laws of nature. Acting in accordance with the moral law is not acting from an external standard, but in acting in accordance with a law we legislate to ourselves (autonomy) -- rational nature. 
- When you give a law to yourself, it comes from without autonomy: you no longer have a parent imposing paternal law on you.

The Story
- SOical contract theorists: subjects are bound to respect a regime's authority when they consent to it in return for improvement over the state of nature
- Hume's objection: social contract theory is a dangerous fiction, vicious circular reasoning. People start revolutions. 
- Kant's reply: stop thinking about the social contract with this metaphysical baggage, but with reason: the social contract is a heuristic deivce, similar to the categorical imperative, whose function is to reveal to us our political rights and duties.
    - Armchair theoriizing: we can see the obligations entailed from it as dictates of reason
    - Ends up looking a lot like Rousseau

Two ways of reading Kant
- Utilitarian and commutarian

Hellenistic Philosophy
- Aristotle and St. Thoomas Aquinas
- Epicureans: pleasure is the greatest good. 
- Stoics: overcome your emotions. Pursue self-control. Kant is kind of a stoic. Utilitarianism is a revolt of the epicureans.

Utilitarianism
- Most influential moral doctrine in the English speaking world until about 1970.
- Until 1971, when John Rawls decimates it (althouguh it's back now)
- Presents itself as being objective, in the sense that we can all see the results and judge them.
- It is a doctrine that appeals to us as we are and therefore can influence our actions
- Utility-based, not rights-based
- Value of something -- measurable utility (marginal utility)

Return to Hume
- Utilitarian objection to Kant: the notion of autonomy. Rises out of Humean skepticism towards most moral and political principles.
- Hume's skpeticism: humans are creatures of habit, not reason; reason is the slave of the passions.
- Humans are moved to act out of emotion and custom, not reason. 
- Differences in thinking about autonomy: Kantian, you did not respect peoples' autonomy. You acted like a parent. You punish and you reward, treating people like children. Humean reply: But do people even have autonomy? Nah.
- Utilitarian: we are all about consequences and figuring out what gets people to do the thing which needs to be done. 
- Knowledge and rationality -- certain fetishism by Kant. Don't go to Kant if you want to be a social activist. Kant tells you what the morally right thing to do -- you'll have to do things which are inconsistent with autonomy.

Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832)
- Natural rights are nonsense upon stilts
- Greatest happiness principle: act so that you can produce the greatest aggregate happiness for all sentient beings

John Stuart Mill (1806-1873)
- Unhappy with Hedonistic calculus: introduces lexically ordered goods
- Mill does not dismiss notion of rights -- rights (rules) are based upon promotion of utility
- Mill is Bentham's godson -- Bentham is "utterly mean and gorveling as a doctrine worthy only of swine"
- The problem with utilitarian -- how to measure and classify
- Mill's harm principle: the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant.

Karl Marx (1818 - 1883)
- Problems with capitalism: capitalism deforms and exploits workers; distorts reality; is becoming obselte
- With Katn and the utilitarians, their political philosophy is based on their morality -- morality si what you grounds your politics
- Marx: morality is a bourgeois concept -- it's very Rousseauan and Thrasymachian, always there to maintain the mode of production. Here to maintain the lord-serf relationship. 
- Marx thinks he's being very scientific, and is making a host of moral claims which lie untouched. 
- Marx expands Rousseau's inisght about unnatural inequalities
- Kant and the utilitarians are very individualistic -- Marx is not so much communitarian as he is a structuralist: not only how structures have different outcomes -- you can't just put really good people into the ruling class; there will be certain outputs. Structures make you what you are. 
- Realm of freedom -- what is freedom? Freedom begins only where labor determined by necessity and external expediency ends -- humans have been laboring just to survive. Moments of actual freedom are when we are not doing it for survival; these are the few moments of real freedom. Society should strive to have maximum freedom (leisure?)

Marxist Criticism of Kant
- Marx and Kant are in agreement that freedom requires a rational society and that in such a society people will be treated as ends in themselves. 
- For Marx, people are not born fully formed, rational individuals -- they must begin so by freeing them from capitalist society. Communities shape individuals.
- For Marx, societies based on exploitation and alienation inevitably produce deformed individuals -- individuals who cannot act in accordance with reason.
- geist (Hegel): comes to know itself
- A rational society must come first (a socialist society). For Marx, no socialism means no kingdom of ends.

From Marx and Mills to Rawls
