## "Famine, Affluence, and Morality" -- Peter Singer (1972)
- November 1971 -- East Bengal starvation and death is not irreconcilable; it is not a 'natural' problem but rather a human one, people have not given enough to relief funds (2)
- The Bengal emergency is one of many emergencies, and we need to change how we (as citizens of affluent countries) look at them (3)
- Assumption: suffering and death from lack of basic neccessities is bad. If we are able to prevent something bad without a similarly high moral sacrifice, we are morally obligated to do so (3)
- Although this latter principle seems obvious, in fact it fundametnally changes how we are to live our lives.
- Derivations:
    - Distance does not matter, so the neighbor's child should not have any difference from the Bengali child (5). We cannot discriminate upon someone merely by their distance.
    - It does not matter if I am the only one or if I am just one among a few in the same position (5). Even if there is a psychological difference, this does not necessarily mean anything for our moral obligations.
- There may be a paradox: that one should give all of what one has until they are barely surviving, and there emerges an excess for the Bengals. But this assumes that the relief is given unexpectedly and simultaneously
- Traditional moral categories are disrupted. Duty vs charity -- no longer such a clean divide. (8)
    - People do not feel guilty about spending money on new resources instead of giving it to famine relief. This cannot be justified.
    - To give is not to be charitable or generous, but your duty.
    - Giving is not supererogatory: we ought to give money away, and it is wrong not to do so.
- Objection: this is too deviant, too foreign a concept (9)
    - Descriptive vs normative
    - Sidgwick and Urmson: a basic mroal code must not too far supercede the capacities of the ordinary man
- We ought to be preventing as much suffering as we can do. And this is an obligation which remains despite our success in fulfilling it. (11)
- Some will point towards the state, and this is good, but one should not then retract their giving unless this giving will likely prompt the state to give much more (12)
- A moderate principle and a strong principle: no reason to choose the former over the latter, but that the former is hard to accept is awa moment of reflection in itself. (14-15)
- What role do philosophers play in public affairs? Supposedly it is descriptive. 
- Philosophers must practice what they preach, and start by giving. Harmony of theory and practice (16)

## "Justice and International Relations" -- Charles Beitz (1975)
- Certainly there are humanist arguments that those in affluent countries shuold support those in poorer countries. But are there stronger obligations to justice? Structural reform?
  - Utilitarian: diff. between humanitarian aid and social justice obligations are not important. Utility does not respect natural boundaries.
  - Contractarian: people stand in a national community united by common acceptance of a concepiton of justice
- Criticisms of Rawls: principles ought to apply globally (universally), not just across the nation-state.

I: Rawls on International Justice
- Justice is the first virtue of social institutions.
- The primary subject of justice is the basic structure of society -- the way in which social institutions distribute fundametnal rights and duties and determine the division of advantages from social cooperation.
- If national boundaries are significant, then justice does not hold across people of different nationality.
- When we assume countries are interdependent, principles need to apply at a global level.
- The original position can be considered as a sort of international conference.
  - The law of nations for Rawls applies to a world of just states.
  - Original position is incomplete for international situations.
- Two elements for material advancement of society: cooperative activity and the natural component
  - Cooperative activity: subject to domestic principles of justice
  - Nautral component: morally relevant even without international cooperation

II: Natural Resources
- Natural resources are distributed unevenly
- Natural endowments are neither just nor unjust, but natural facts.
- An unjust society distributes the benefits of social cooperation according to a morally arbitrary criterion.
- Problems with Rawls' treatment of 'natural talents'
  - Unclear what morally arbitrary means
  - Natural talents are part of the self, and perhaps one's talents are protected by personal liberty consdierations.
- Parallel to resources:
  - Resource endowments are arbitrary in that they are not deserved
  - Unlike talents, resources are not attached to people
- Talents are what the self is -- they help constitute personality. But natural resources seem more oncintgent; not parts of the self to begin wtih, need to be appropriated first. Personal liberty claims do not apply in the same way.
- Natural distribution of resources is purer than a 'morally arbitrary' distribution fo talents.
- NO one has a naturally given prima facie claim to resources which 'happen' to be in their land
- Under the veil of ignorance, parties agree to an equitable resource redistribution principle
- What counts as a natural resource? Does food count as a natural resource? 

III
- So far, assumed that nations are self-sufficient cooperative schemes, but this is empirically untrue.

AI Provided Summary
- Section I: The author introduces the question of global justice and criticizes Rawls’ theory of justice for neglecting it. He argues that Rawls’ two principles of justice, which apply to domestic societies, do not adequately address the issues of international justice, such as the distribution of natural resources and the effects of economic interdependence. He suggests that Rawls’ brief remarks on the law of nations, which are based on a hypothetical international original position, are incomplete and unrealistic. He proposes to extend and modify Rawls’ theory to account for the moral implications of global social cooperation.
- Section II: The author reviews Rawls’ discussion of international justice and shows that it makes sense only on the empirical assumption that nation-states are self-sufficient. He then challenges this assumption and shows that it neglects certain problems about natural resources. He claims that the natural distribution of resources is morally arbitrary and requires redistribution under a resource redistribution principle. He compares this principle to the difference principle and the just savings principle in domestic societies.
- Section III: The author questions the empirical foundation of the self-sufficiency assumption and sketches the consequences for Rawlsian ideal theory of abandoning it. He argues that evidence of global economic and political interdependence shows the existence of a global scheme of social cooperation, which requires global principles of justice. He suggests that Rawls’ own two principles, suitably reinterpreted, could themselves be applied globally. He explains how the original position would be modified to reflect the global scope of social cooperation.
- Section IV: The author explores the relation of an ideal theory of international justice to some representative problems of politics in the nonideal world. He discusses how global principles would apply to cases involving unjust wars, human rights violations, foreign aid, and resource conservation. He acknowledges some difficulties and limitations of his approach and calls for further inquiry into the question of global justice.
