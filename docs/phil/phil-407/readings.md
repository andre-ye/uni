## "Famine, Affluence, and Morality" -- Peter Singer (1972)
- November 1971 -- East Bengal starvation and death is not irreconcilable; it is not a 'natural' problem but rather a human one, people have not given enough to relief funds (2)
- The Bengal emergency is one of many emergencies, and we need to change how we (as citizens of affluent countries) look at them (3)
- Assumption: suffering and death from lack of basic neccessities is bad. If we are able to prevent something bad without a similarly high moral sacrifice, we are morally obligated to do so (3)
- Although this latter principle seems obvious, in fact it fundametnally changes how we are to live our lives.
- Derivations:
    - Distance does not matter, so the neighbor's child should not have any difference from the Bengali child (5). We cannot discriminate upon someone merely by their distance.
    - It does not matter if I am the only one or if I am just one among a few in the same position (5). Even if there is a psychological difference, this does not necessarily mean anything for our moral obligations.
- There may be a paradox: that one should give all of what one has until they are barely surviving, and there emerges an excess for the Bengals. But this assumes that the relief is given unexpectedly and simultaneously
- Traditional moral categories are disrupted. Duty vs charity -- no longer such a clean divide. (8)
    - People do not feel guilty about spending money on new resources instead of giving it to famine relief. This cannot be justified.
    - To give is not to be charitable or generous, but your duty.
    - Giving is not supererogatory: we ought to give money away, and it is wrong not to do so.
- Objection: this is too deviant, too foreign a concept (9)
    - Descriptive vs normative
    - Sidgwick and Urmson: a basic mroal code must not too far supercede the capacities of the ordinary man
- We ought to be preventing as much suffering as we can do. And this is an obligation which remains despite our success in fulfilling it. (11)
- Some will point towards the state, and this is good, but one should not then retract their giving unless this giving will likely prompt the state to give much more (12)
- A moderate principle and a strong principle: no reason to choose the former over the latter, but that the former is hard to accept is awa moment of reflection in itself. (14-15)
- What role do philosophers play in public affairs? Supposedly it is descriptive. 
- Philosophers must practice what they preach, and start by giving. Harmony of theory and practice (16)
