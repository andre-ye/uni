## "Famine, Affluence, and Morality" -- Peter Singer (1972)
- November 1971 -- East Bengal starvation and death is not irreconcilable; it is not a 'natural' problem but rather a human one, people have not given enough to relief funds (2)
- The Bengal emergency is one of many emergencies, and we need to change how we (as citizens of affluent countries) look at them (3)
- Assumption: suffering and death from lack of basic neccessities is bad. If we are able to prevent something bad without a similarly high moral sacrifice, we are morally obligated to do so (3)
- Although this latter principle seems obvious, in fact it fundametnally changes how we are to live our lives.
- Derivations:
    - Distance does not matter, so the neighbor's child should not have any difference from the Bengali child (5). We cannot discriminate upon someone merely by their distance.
    - It does not matter if I am the only one or if I am just one among a few in the same position (5). Even if there is a psychological difference, this does not necessarily mean anything for our moral obligations.
- There may be a paradox: that one should give all of what one has until they are barely surviving, and there emerges an excess for the Bengals. But this assumes that the relief is given unexpectedly and simultaneously
- Traditional moral categories are disrupted. Duty vs charity -- no longer such a clean divide. (8)
    - People do not feel guilty about spending money on new resources instead of giving it to famine relief. This cannot be justified.
    - To give is not to be charitable or generous, but your duty.
    - Giving is not supererogatory: we ought to give money away, and it is wrong not to do so.
- Objection: this is too deviant, too foreign a concept (9)
    - Descriptive vs normative
    - Sidgwick and Urmson: a basic mroal code must not too far supercede the capacities of the ordinary man
- We ought to be preventing as much suffering as we can do. And this is an obligation which remains despite our success in fulfilling it. (11)
- Some will point towards the state, and this is good, but one should not then retract their giving unless this giving will likely prompt the state to give much more (12)
- A moderate principle and a strong principle: no reason to choose the former over the latter, but that the former is hard to accept is awa moment of reflection in itself. (14-15)
- What role do philosophers play in public affairs? Supposedly it is descriptive. 
- Philosophers must practice what they preach, and start by giving. Harmony of theory and practice (16)

## "Justice and International Relations" -- Charles Beitz (1975)
- Certainly there are humanist arguments that those in affluent countries shuold support those in poorer countries. But are there stronger obligations to justice? Structural reform?
  - Utilitarian: diff. between humanitarian aid and social justice obligations are not important. Utility does not respect natural boundaries.
  - Contractarian: people stand in a national community united by common acceptance of a concepiton of justice
- Criticisms of Rawls: principles ought to apply globally (universally), not just across the nation-state.

I: Rawls on International Justice
- Justice is the first virtue of social institutions.
- The primary subject of justice is the basic structure of society -- the way in which social institutions distribute fundametnal rights and duties and determine the division of advantages from social cooperation.
- If national boundaries are significant, then justice does not hold across people of different nationality.
- When we assume countries are interdependent, principles need to apply at a global level.
- The original position can be considered as a sort of international conference.
  - The law of nations for Rawls applies to a world of just states.
  - Original position is incomplete for international situations.
- Two elements for material advancement of society: cooperative activity and the natural component
  - Cooperative activity: subject to domestic principles of justice
  - Nautral component: morally relevant even without international cooperation

II: Natural Resources
- Natural resources are distributed unevenly
- Natural endowments are neither just nor unjust, but natural facts.
- An unjust society distributes the benefits of social cooperation according to a morally arbitrary criterion.
- Problems with Rawls' treatment of 'natural talents'
  - Unclear what morally arbitrary means
  - Natural talents are part of the self, and perhaps one's talents are protected by personal liberty consdierations.
- Parallel to resources:
  - Resource endowments are arbitrary in that they are not deserved
  - Unlike talents, resources are not attached to people
- Talents are what the self is -- they help constitute personality. But natural resources seem more oncintgent; not parts of the self to begin wtih, need to be appropriated first. Personal liberty claims do not apply in the same way.
- Natural distribution of resources is purer than a 'morally arbitrary' distribution fo talents.
- NO one has a naturally given prima facie claim to resources which 'happen' to be in their land
- Under the veil of ignorance, parties agree to an equitable resource redistribution principle
- What counts as a natural resource? Does food count as a natural resource? 

III
- So far, assumed that nations are self-sufficient cooperative schemes, but this is empirically untrue.
- Capital surpluses are reinvested in conditiosn which promise the highest yield. Value created in one part of the world benefits a richer part of the world.
- Poor countries lose political economy
- Economic interdependence involves largely nonvoluntary relationships
- National boundaries are not the outer limits of social cooperation -- this is empirically true.
- So do national boundaries have any fundametnal moral significance?
- National societies can no longer be viewed as ultimate
- Objections to Rawls applied at the global level seem not to hold up.
- Relations between nations appear more voluntary than relations between citizens in a state.

IV
- Rawls' derivation of principles of justice for the law of nations is incomplete -- neglected resource redistribution
- The self-sufficiency assumption is empricially unsupported.
- A state-centered image of the world loses its normative relevance in a globally economically interdependent world.
- What relevance do social ideals have for politics in the real world?
- Rawls: the natural duty of justice
- Ideal theory gives us criteria for formualting strategies of political action in the nonideal world
- In the nonideal world, the natural duty of justice may conflict with other duties
- Nonintervention vs commitment to protection of civil rights
- The contract doctrine can help us more from statist to global understandings of international justice

> For purposes of moral choice, we must, instead, regard the world from the perspective of an original position from which matters of national citizenship are excluded by an extended veil of ignorance

AI Provided Summary
- Section I: The author introduces the question of global justice and criticizes Rawls’ theory of justice for neglecting it. He argues that Rawls’ two principles of justice, which apply to domestic societies, do not adequately address the issues of international justice, such as the distribution of natural resources and the effects of economic interdependence. He suggests that Rawls’ brief remarks on the law of nations, which are based on a hypothetical international original position, are incomplete and unrealistic. He proposes to extend and modify Rawls’ theory to account for the moral implications of global social cooperation.
- Section II: The author reviews Rawls’ discussion of international justice and shows that it makes sense only on the empirical assumption that nation-states are self-sufficient. He then challenges this assumption and shows that it neglects certain problems about natural resources. He claims that the natural distribution of resources is morally arbitrary and requires redistribution under a resource redistribution principle. He compares this principle to the difference principle and the just savings principle in domestic societies.
- Section III: The author questions the empirical foundation of the self-sufficiency assumption and sketches the consequences for Rawlsian ideal theory of abandoning it. He argues that evidence of global economic and political interdependence shows the existence of a global scheme of social cooperation, which requires global principles of justice. He suggests that Rawls’ own two principles, suitably reinterpreted, could themselves be applied globally. He explains how the original position would be modified to reflect the global scope of social cooperation.
- Section IV: The author explores the relation of an ideal theory of international justice to some representative problems of politics in the nonideal world. He discusses how global principles would apply to cases involving unjust wars, human rights violations, foreign aid, and resource conservation. He acknowledges some difficulties and limitations of his approach and calls for further inquiry into the question of global justice.

## "Humanity and Justice in Global Perspective", Brian Barry (1982)

Three theses
- Considerations of humanity require rich countries to give aid to poor ones
- Considerations of justice require transfers from rich countries to poor ones
- Aid vs transfer: obligations imposed by humanity and justice are different, although not incompatible.

Humanity
- What would it mean to act in a humane way? A human act is beneficient.
- humanity -- the relief of distress.
- Three questions:
  1. Is it morally obligatory to behave humanely, or simply laudable?
  2. What implications does moral obligations have for the distribution of resources?
  3. On what criterion do we determine how much rich countries should give to poor ones?
- Indeed, there are duties of humanity (e.g. save the drowning child).
- Does the drowning child extent to international aid? Yes
  - Countries are responsible for their economic problems. But this does not mean that we should not help them, even if it is true, which it is likely not. 
  - SInger: neither proximity nor number of rescuers matters. Some objections: well proximity is just infeasible. But we should not contract the sphere of opertion because we can't do anything. Or maybe presence of other rescuers does matter. But if the child dorwns because none of the potential rescuers save it, all of them are morally responsible.
  - Argument of bureaucratic inefficiency: there will be a lot of waste. But what is left over will help a non-negliglbe amount. 
  - Neo-Malthusian argument: only effect is to lead to population increase and more suffering. But empriically this is not true.
  - Ideological and political dogmas can change, and we should not be under the illusion that they cannot (and hide behind it to withhold giving aid).
- How much aid is required?
  - One is obliged to help up to a point in which one sacrifices somehting of "comparable moral importance" -- maximizing consequentialism.
  - But do we really have an obligation to maximize the total amount of good in the universe?
  - There is no firm criterion for how much sacrifice is required. But there is a greater obligation the more severe the distress.
  - Kind of 'you know when you see it' answer as far as I estimate

Justice
- We should not expect to get a blueprint for a good society from a conception of justice.
- Obligation is not derived from justice
- Justice is a set of reasons why people may have duties to one another and institutions
- Justice as reciprocity
  - Justice as fidelity: keeping faith
  - Justice as requital: fair return / exchange
  - Jusitce as fair play: one should not be a free rider by taking the benefits. One can use the principle of fair play to rescue the drowning child without commiting oneself to a universal obligation of rescue. 
- Drowning child case is overdetermined when duty of fair play underwrites rescue: reinfrocement between humanity, fidelity and fiar play. 
  - Obligations to humanity do not depend on consdierations of reciprocity
- This is the Rawlsian entrance: society is a scheme of social cooperation from which we get the concepts of justice; but it only generates whatever its cooperative practices justice. Rawls can only say that a society suffers from collective irrationality but cannot cannot show a society is unjust.
- Charles Beitz argues for the global difference principle.
  - One cannot use a cooperative scheme to argue that it is unfair not to have more cooperation
  - The whole world does not constitute necessarily a single cooperative partnership
  - International redistribution does not necessarily help both rich and poor countries.
- Does trade constitute a cooperative scheme? Trade does not give rise to the duties of fair play per se -- it must be that public goods are collectively enjoyed. But there is no sort of shared unitization from trade.
  - Trade is, however, the rudimentary organs of international cooperation
  - Is there mutual beneficiality? Redistribution on the insurance principle has little appeal for rich countries
- Justice as Equal Rights
  - HLA Hart: are there any natural rights? Speical rights must presuppose general rights
  - Just as reciprocity needs rights to be assigned already.
  - The question is the initial injustice of rights.
  - The 'pre-predicative' distribution of rights is equal.
- The equality principle can be exploited by first-world countries to take third world countries'resources
- International institutions
  - Perfect Humean equilibrium: existence of redistributive institutions, beliefs on the legitimacy of redistribution -- organize each other.
  - The public sets the very terms of the conversation. (hmm... what is he really saying here?)
- International Taxation (24)
  - Two alternative approaches to a taxation scheme:
    - base taxes on both humanitarian and justice grounds
    - have comprehensive taxes and distribute proceeds among poor countries
  - Tax governments of rich countries and distribute to poor countries
  - GNP reflects use of irreplacable natural resources
  - Taxes not related to some aspect of justice should be rejected -- it's too arbitrary. This money should go straight to poor countries

The Relations Between Humanity and Justice
- Both humanity and justice require a substantial expansion in the scale of economic transfers
- Rationales are different, and so are practical implications.
- Rights and goals. Obligations of humanity are goal-based (aggregative); obligations of justice are rights-based (distributive)
- Humanity directs us to relieve suffering where it occurs -- concerned with well-being and fulfillment.
- Justice is concerned with the good and the bad states, and what responsibilities we have towards the former.
  - Subject matter: distribution of control over material resources
- Humanity is a question of doing good; justice is a question of power
- What is the difference between distribution of *stuff* against *welfare*?
- Justice is concerned with materials which support the material means of well-being.
  - Is justice then concerned with the goal of well-being? Is justice a derivative principle?
  - Two questions: What is the deployment of resources to promote happiness and reduce misery? What is the ethically defensible basis for allocating control over resources?
- Rich countries concede a humanitarian obligation to assist poor countries.
- Even with humanitarian aid, there is a division between donor countries free to spend 'their' incomes; donee countries must be 'responsible'
- Justice consideration transfers: reduce the resources of one set of countries, and add it to another set. So it is more about redistribution than anything -- about the power to even decide what humanitarian goals even mean for that country.
- If resources are justly owed to a country, then they are that country's, period.
- A world with an international authority which allows countries to keep income which is justly distributed internally rejects principles of national autonomy.
- The price of autonomy is the permission of waste.
- However we cannot have autonomy for some and Marxist supervision for tohers -- that would not be just.
- We cannot talk about humanity unless we have a baseline set by justice.  
- The need for humanitarian aid is reduced in a world which has a basically just international distribtuion.

## "What Is So Special about Our Fellow Countrymen?" -- Robert E. Goodin (1988)
- We have some duties towards people because they are people, and special duties to those in particular relation with us
- Sometimes we have stronger duties to those outside our nation than those within it.
- What morally matters is not nationality per se

The Particularist's Challenge
- Modern moral philosophy has been very universalistic, even if it has varied applications
- Corollary of universality is impartiality
- Utilitarians and Kantians unite!
- Perhaps universalism is a feature of morality itself.
- Perhaps there are special duties to some people that we don't have to others
  - Maybe it is an addition to moral law.
  - Maybe it is extramoral.
  - Maybe it is derivative to universalism.
- Do we owe compatriots a special sort of treatment? Common-sense morality largely consists of such obligations.
- What is the true nature of special duties?

The Case of Compatriots
- It is usually assumed that we owe more to our fellow compatriots than to foreigners
- We can, through public officials, take the property of our fellow citizens for public purposes, but not the same for a foreigner
- We can conscript citizens for service but not foreigners
- We can tax citizens but not foreigners residing abroad on income earned abroad
- Basically we can fuck over people in our vicinity because they are within our power, but we have to be more careful with foreigners.
- But also citizens are allowed to vote, we should treat them better, etc.
- The situation is very mixed indeed

Special Duties as Magnifiers and Multipliers
- Commonsense morality tends to employ two basic models, magnifiers and multipliers
- Magnifiers
  - Imperfect duties are transformed into perfect duties
  - No one should starve, but it is especially wrong that our compatriots should starve.
  - But if we want to magnify duties, then positive duties should be stronger, but also so should negative duties.
  - Certainly, positive duties become stronger.
  - But negative duties do not become stronger. In fact non-nationals have stronger negative duties than nationals.
- Multipliers: special relationships multiply existing duties, i.e. creating new special duties other than the general ones *de novo* from contracts.
  - Does this apply for negative duties? In fact, special relationships require *sacrificing* negative duties in favor of positive ones.
  - Multiplication produces more duties, but we find less (negative) ones.
- A relationship remains a two-way affair, and special duties follow from this contract.
- Each one of us suffers from additional duties which impose an extra burden of us, which is the weakning of negative duties.
  - This imposition is legitimate because there are special contracts.
  - This is the standard social contract position, in the state of nature there are no duties
  - People welcome special relationships because strengthening positive duties comes with a weakning of negative duties.
  - However, magnifier and multiplieir models have been reduced to "mutual benefit socieities" -- but this is not the case.

The Mutual Benefit Society Model
- We have a strong obligation to leave foreigners as we found them, according to conventional wisdom.
- Nation-states are conceptualized as mutual-benefit societies. It is permissible to impose sacrifices so they may benefit in the future.
- Basically, under this model, if you are in, then we focus on improving your condition (possibly via short-term harms). But if you are not, then we focus on not harming you (at the expense of development).
- Suppose national boundaries circumscribe mutual benefit societies. 
- The issue is determining who is inside the club and who is outside the club
- Who is a citizen? What is not? Who gets to be a member of the club?
- Counterexamples
  - Resident aliens: net contributors to society, but denied full benefits.
  - Natural born citizens: may be net drains on society, but given full benefits.
- Mutual benefit soceity requires that people's benefits from society are proportional to the sacrifices they have made towards that production.
  - We only have special duties to those whose cooperation benefits us.
- Maybe border lines are mere formalistic devices for identifying possible members of contribution to the mutual benefit society.
- Many societies exploit "guest workers" -- using mutual benefit society logic, this is blatantly wrong.

The Assigned Responsibility Model
- Special duties are mere distributed general duties.

> Special duties are in my view merely devices by which the moral community's general duties get assigned to particular agents. For this reason, I call mine an "assigned responsibility" model.

- Special duties are merely derivative from general duties
- Special duties are susceptible to being overriden and have no special independent force.
- Our fellow countrymen are not so special after all
- Drowning swimmer on the beach: no one is naturally picked out as the appropriate person to help, if everyone helped they woudl get in each other's way, so socially we have a lifeguard.
- States have special duties to their citizens, but not in any 'specially special' way. They are merely general duties which everyone has to everyone worldwide.
- There are certainly reasons why nationality might have psychological force, but these are not moral reasons. They influence the redrawing of boundaries *in service of* special responsibilities.
- No state has a claim against other states for positive assistance in promoting its own citizens' interest (that is its own responsibility)
- We are obliged to leave foreigners as we have found them because they have been assigned to another state.
- Mutual benefit society says that those who do not contribute to society should be cast out. But the state is responsible to them and discharges general rights.
- Everyone must be assigned an advocate or protector.
- In mutual-benefit logic, boundaries circumscribe groups of people who produce benefits for each other; by the assigned responsibility model, states should be assigned to be able to care for their citizens.

Conclusion
- Boundaries matter, but it is boundaries around *people* which matter.
- We shouldn't fetishize boundaries. They are useful boundareis.
- Citizenship is a device for fixign speical responsibility.

> In the present world system, it is often-perhaps ordinarily-wrong to give priority to the claims of our compatriots.

(Why so?)

Notes -- it seems this model is convincing, and has good normative recommendations. But it does not seem to address the much more pressing questions of how these normative recommendations square with the state of the world.
For instance, some nation-states may argue that they cannot serve their own citizens' interests because historically they have been exploited by other nation-states. Therefore they demand reparations, and even commit terrorism, etc. What is to be done here?
It seems this model does not have a good account of conflict, or of secession and annexation.
What about colonialism?
If the quality of life improves for people, then is it right?
Does consent factor here?
What does this have to say about immigration?
We should accept as much until we cannot serve our own population.
Does this article account for justice?

## "The Ethical Significance of Nationality" -- David Miller (1988)

I: Introduction, exposition of argument, definition of nation / nationality
- Objective: defend the view that national boundaries are ethically significant
- We behave as if this were true, e.g. for welfare measures
- Prominent thrust of ethical theories towards universalism, independent of local connections
- An argument directed against naive internationalism with inadequate ethical development
- Realist tones underlying the introduction
- National boundaries are not the same as borders between states
  - National identities may be shared across states
  - "You know it when you see it"
  - There is no objective criterion which demarcates nations
  - "Nationality is essentially a subjective phenomenon, constituted by the sahred beliefs of a set of people: a belief that each belongs together with the rest; that this association is neither transitory nor merely instrumental but stems from a long history of living together"
  - Some level of political autonomy and poltiical aspiration
  - It does not matter if the beliefs that members hold in a nation are necessary true.
  - Can moraly accomodate those who hold false beliefs?

II. Particularism vs universalism
- Surely ethics must be definition deriv efrom universal and rationally grounded principles
- The issue is that the moral subject is treated as an abstract individual possessed with capacities of human beings but not fundamentally committed to any particualr particularities.
- Particular duties, responsibilities, and rights are never regarded fundamentally (always derived from the rational and the universal)
- On the other hand, consider another perspective in which the subject is already seen as deeply embedded in social relationships already with (partial) commitments. The agent can aspire to rationality, but it is not abstract rationality, rather reflecting on existing commitments.
- Examinations
  - Maybe my group does not really exist as a group, my commitment is based on false assumptions
  - Are my existing commitments coherent? Maybe there is a contradiction in my commitments and I cannot be both kinds of people, and I need to decide which commitment is more fundamental
- Ethical particularism is not a simply irrationalist outlook which elevates existing prejudices to objective truths.
- Miller's defense is that it is practical to have these ambitions.

III. Existing universalist approaches do not consider nationality to be significant
- "Universalism can generate surrogates for national attachments but not the genuine article"
- We can interpret the significance of social boundaries in contractual Kantian terms. "Mutual benefit societies".
  - Problems that Goodin raises
  - But also: obligations are tied to existing practices. Yet in the absence of practice I have no obligation to contribute. So basically these contract theories apply more to states than nations.
  - Nationality is not a cooperative practice as much as it is a grouunding for such a practice -- it is a preexisting attachment.
  - The ethical significance of nationality might remain even if states do not eist to capture them.
- Goodin's approach: interpret boundaries as a convenient way to allocate responsibilities that derive from general duties.
  - How utilitarians approach the boundaries issue -- a solution to a coordination / distribution problem.
  - Issues
  - Boundaries enclose people with very different levels of living. Whya re we putting the badly off in charge of the badly off and the well off in charge of the well off? 
  - Again, applies to states and not really to nationality.
- Most accounts of special duties ignore nationality altogether.
- But Miller wants to take nationality seriously.

IV: Articulating the critique of the nation
- Particularists use specific attachments to make their point *under the expectation that they will carry particular weight*
- 20th century nationalism has left a distaste in liberals' and Leftists' mouths. Perhaps the nation itself is a suspect category.
- Nations are "imagined communities" -- bounds are fictitious, national allegiances cannot withstand rational reflection
- In one sense, nations cannot be genuine communities. But there are also broader concepts of communities, e.g. "The Jewish community"
- Nations are not formed from ethnic self-definition but the "exigencies of power" -- antionality is a manufactured item. It is a work of invention built on shared history. Creating an "ideological myth of origins and descent"
- Does the mythic origin history at the center of a nation make national loyalties incapable of withstanding rational reflection?
- Distinction:
  - Beliefs which constitutive social relationships 
  - Beliefs in the background which support constitutive beliefs
    - Genetic relationships are a support to the actual lovingness and mutual supports which make a family a family
    - The family remains intact even if there is a false belief.
- The mythical origin story of a nation counts as a backgroundr ather than as a constitutive belief. The story is told for self-definition, and the relationships which form out of that persist even as the scaffold falls away.
- Suppposedly it is constitutive of national identity that members of a nation have shared characteristics which justify political aggregation. Criticism: nationalities are heterogeneous populations masquerading as ethnic groups
- Can there be a public culture shared among people with differing private cultures?
- Nationality is going to inevitably trespass some on ethnicity and require curtailing of ethnic identity

V: Responding to critiques of the nation
- Two strategies to respond to the critique of nationality
- Remain in the particularist framework, defend national identities from within -- defend the nation as an object of attachment
  - Using the nation as the "object of allegiance' is not necessarily worse than other possible objects. Is ethnicity a more genuine form of allegiance than nationality? Ethnic identities are plastic too. Everything is plastic, socially fictitious. Nationality is rather self-sufficient and subject to rational control. The nation has political autonomy whereas other institutions do not. So it is better as a system for organizing political life.
- Accept universalist terms and show on impartialist criteria that it is a good thing for people to have national attachments. (of course this is weak for particularists.)

VI: A universalist commentary -- the dog crumbs
- "Government house utilitarianism" -- only a select minority can guide ethical behavior by universalist criteria. Therefore the universal stands in for the partciular.
- Philip Pettit: a consequentialist case for acknowledging different specific loyalties
- Does the universalist standard have practical force?
- Michael Walzer: distributive justice presupposes a bounded world in which distribution takes place. But what is the scope of this bounded world? Nothing strictly incoherent in seeking to extend the range to cover the entire globe, but this is widely implausible.
- Universalist case for nationality creates communities with the widest feasible membership
- Acton: multinational state
- Hayek: anxiety that liberalism is being corrupted by socialism and nationalism (inseparable), trible sentiments like the Great Society
- Is our ethical concern a commodity in limited supply?
- If we beign from a universalist criteria, we will not end up with nationality as the optimal basis for special obligations, still.

## "Cosmopolitanism and Sovereignty" -- Pogge (1992)
- The human future seems open
- Fukuyamist vision of the end of history -- mutual pacifism of capitalist democracies
- Borders become redrawn
- Gradual global institutional reform
- Pogge is something of a conventional liberal? Maybe?

Institutional Cosmopolitanism based on Human Rights
- All cosmopolitan positions share three elements:
  - Individiualism: ultimate units of concern are human beings rather than states or other collectives
  - Universalism: concern for individuals is truly across all individualisms
  - Generality: there is global force, persons are units of concern for everyone, not only compatriots, fellow religionists, etc.
- **Distinction**: Legal vs moral cosmopolitanism
  - Legal cosmopolitanism: concrete political ideal of a global order where all persons have equivalent legal rights and duties
  - Moral cosmopolitanism: all persons stand in certain moral relations to one another
  - Pogge is concerned with moral cosmopolitanism
  - Central idea: every human being has global stature as an ultimate unit of moral concern
- **Distinction**: institutional vs interactional conceptions
  - Institutional conception: postulates fundamental principles of justice which apply to institutional schemes
  - Interactional conception: postulates fundamental principles of ethics which are first-order in applying to persons and groups
  - Interactional cosmopolitanism assigns direct rersponsibility to other agents, whereas institutional cosmopolitanism assigns it to institutional schemes (persons' responsibilities are indirect)
  - Pogge foucuses on institutional cosmopolitanism
- Two limitations of institutional conception.
  - Contingent applicability (emergence of social institutions)
  - Global moral force of human rights activated only via global scheme of social institutions.
  - These do not violate generality
- Institutional approach goes beyond simple libertarianism without falling into a utilitarianism of rights which disregards our causal relation to harms.
- Under the institutional view, third parties may be implicated more directly in human rights violations, whereas third parties can be neutral under the interactional view.
  - Institutional view broadens those who can be responsible without having to affirm positive duties
- Negative duties may generate positive oglibations.
- Interactional $$\to$$ institutional prevents First World citizens from viewing themselves as morally disconnected from less fortune citizens of the Third World.
- We share a collective responsibility for the justice of the existing global order
- Is our global institutional scheme causallyr esponsible for current deprivations?
- Focus on explanations: macroexplanation, microexplanation, etc. -- do global differences indicate local explanations?
- What is the 'practical' moral importance of shared responsibility for justice in a global institutional scheme?
- One counterargument: an institutional scheme has highly limited bounds of responsibility. Implausible!
  - Irrational to assess social institutions without looking at effects
  - Social institutions are human artifacts
  - Incidental effects are normally taken into account in debates
- A **consequentialist** account of social institutions
- Michael Walzer: Distributive justice presupposes a bounded world, a community within which distributions take place.
  - Attacked by Robert Nozick: there is no central distribution, no group entitled to control all the resources
- Institutional approach involves a conception of distirubtive justice different from Walzer's
  - About how to choose and design economic ground rules which regulate property, cooperation, and exchange
  - This conditions production and distribution without requiring an already existing pool of resources
  - Does not presuppose the existence of a community of persons committed to share with each other (contract theory). 
  - Rather, we face a choice of economic ground rules which are partially open, not fixed.
  - It is in fact morally wrong for affluent participants to perpetuate an unjust economic scheme., regardless of any communal bond
- **Institutional cosmopolitanism does not entail crisp practical conclusions.** It is consequentialist, and therefore mediated by empirical conclusions.
  - Takes seriously a moral question of engendering consequences
  - A **strict implication** from the ground rules of an institutional scheme ("basic structure"?) to the effects
- How is this different from Rawls? -- **question**
- On what basis do we posit the metaphysical existence of human rights? -- **question**
- Inference -- Singer is, by Pogge's model, an interactional cosmopolitan.

The Idea of State Sovereignty
- A is sovreign over B iff
  1. A is a governmental body
  2. B are persons
  3. A has unsupervised and irrevocable authority over B
- Moreover this sovereignty is absolute iff A is sovereign over B and no other agency has authority over A or over B which is not under A.
- Modern political thought: the autonomous territorial state has become the preeminient form of political organization
- Sovereignty is heavily concentrated at the single level. i.e. every individual owes obligations to one nation/state.
- Cosmopolitan morality condemns concentration of sovereignty at one level
- Vertical dispersal of governmental authority -- centralization and decentralization.
- Individuals should govern themselves without dominance of one political unit over the other.

> "People should be politically at home in all of them."

- Objection 1: Sovereignty cannot be divided.
  - Hobbesian and Kantian dogmatism on absolute sovereignty
  - Juridical states must have total control over agency
  - But we can have different branches checking each other and still ahve sovereignty.
  - It is nonsense that sovereignty in a multilayered scheme must be concentrated on one level exclusively. Federalism
- Objection 2: Vertical dispersal of sovereignty does not work for certain functions which are core to sovereingty, e.g. immigration (Walzer).
  - Walzer: insisting on openness to avoid a thousand petty fortresses asks too much of neighborhoods
  - A moral objection to states controlling immigraiton
  - Walzer is right that state control is better than none.
  - But state should have a say to admit neighborhoods willing to accept them. But neighborhoods can also keep them out to keep their culture.

Some main reasons for a vertical dispersal of sovereignty
1. Peace/security: interstate rivalries are currentlys ettled via military competition. National governments do anything they want within their borders. We need a centrally enforced reduction in the dominance of state sovereignty.
2. Reducing oppression -- state sovereignty is used as a cover for domestic oppression, to handle 'their' populations when people are not the property principlally of any one state.
3. Glboal economic justice -- global sovereignty supports redistribution and encourages conservation. Global economic justice is an end in its own right which requires a redistribution of politicla authority.
4. Ecology -- modern processes of production and consumption generate ecologically negative externalities which are often the product of prisoner's dilemmas set up via equivalent sovereign authority of nation-states. The degredation of the environment affects us all.
- A multilayered state provides checks on oppression. Not calling for a world state. Cultural and social diversity too may be better protected at lower-level political units.
- Democracy: people have a right to an institutional order under which those who are affected by a political decision should have equal opportunity to influence its making. Local autonomy
- Objection to a human right to political participation/inclusion: what matters about political decisions is that they are correct, not necessarily their formation process. However, most poltiical choices are not morally closed. And there is a question of responsibility too.
- Three sets of considerations
  - Decentralization -- minimize decision-making burdens on individuals. 
  - Centralization -- necessary to avoid excluding affected persons from being involved in the decision. Kant -- we cannot avoid affecting each other.
  - Correction / balance -- a democratic political process of a unit as small as possible but including all affected persons. What emerges as the best vertical distribution from this balancing?
- Weighting in correction/balance, two notes
  - The oppressed should be given more weight.
  - Commonalities of language, religion, ethnicity, and hisotry are irrelevant. They do not give people a claim to be part of each other's political lives. (China & Taiwan?) 
- Democracy can take many forms. There is no one specific orientation recommended.

The Shaping and Reshaping of Political Units
- A multilayer scheme is a feasible end of progressive gradualism -- requires moderate centralizing and decentralizing wherever appropriate
- Two procedural principles to govern geographical separation of political units *at any level*
  - Inhabitants of any contiguous territory may decide to join a willing and existing political unit.
  - Inhabitants of any contiguous derritory may decide to form a new political unit.
- Conflicts over borders lose much of their intensity. Such conflicts often have morally inappropriate motivations. We often fight over borders because of the centralization of sovereignty at the national level.
- Two amendments
  - Burden of proof rests with advocates of change
  - Require supermajoritarian process
- The question fo paternalism
- Pogge's cosmopolitanism is "committed to the freedom of individual persons and therefore envisions a pluralist global institutional scheme."
- Criteria are partial functions left open to concretization
- Issues with denying that the individual is the fundamental unit of moral concern
- Others accept this premise but formulate the right of persons with essential reference to the state/nation to which they belong. (e.g. Walzer.)
  - Rebuttal: how is the derivation supposed to work?
- Perhaps Pogge is a brutal idealist.
