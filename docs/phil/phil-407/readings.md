## "Famine, Affluence, and Morality" -- Peter Singer (1972)
- November 1971 -- East Bengal starvation and death is not irreconcilable; it is not a 'natural' problem but rather a human one, people have not given enough to relief funds (2)
- The Bengal emergency is one of many emergencies, and we need to change how we (as citizens of affluent countries) look at them (3)
- Assumption: suffering and death from lack of basic neccessities is bad. If we are able to prevent something bad without a similarly high moral sacrifice, we are morally obligated to do so (3)
- Although this latter principle seems obvious, in fact it fundametnally changes how we are to live our lives.
- Derivations:
    - Distance does not matter, so the neighbor's child should not have any difference from the Bengali child (5). We cannot discriminate upon someone merely by their distance.
    - It does not matter if I am the only one or if I am just one among a few in the same position (5). Even if there is a psychological difference, this does not necessarily mean anything for our moral obligations.
- There may be a paradox: that one should give all of what one has until they are barely surviving, and there emerges an excess for the Bengals. But this assumes that the relief is given unexpectedly and simultaneously
- Traditional moral categories are disrupted. Duty vs charity -- no longer such a clean divide. (8)
    - People do not feel guilty about spending money on new resources instead of giving it to famine relief. This cannot be justified.
    - To give is not to be charitable or generous, but your duty.
    - Giving is not supererogatory: we ought to give money away, and it is wrong not to do so.
- Objection: this is too deviant, too foreign a concept (9)
    - Descriptive vs normative
    - Sidgwick and Urmson: a basic mroal code must not too far supercede the capacities of the ordinary man
- We ought to be preventing as much suffering as we can do. And this is an obligation which remains despite our success in fulfilling it. (11)
- Some will point towards the state, and this is good, but one should not then retract their giving unless this giving will likely prompt the state to give much more (12)
- A moderate principle and a strong principle: no reason to choose the former over the latter, but that the former is hard to accept is awa moment of reflection in itself. (14-15)
- What role do philosophers play in public affairs? Supposedly it is descriptive. 
- Philosophers must practice what they preach, and start by giving. Harmony of theory and practice (16)

## "Justice and International Relations" -- Charles Beitz (1975)
- Certainly there are humanist arguments that those in affluent countries shuold support those in poorer countries. But are there stronger obligations to justice? Structural reform?
  - Utilitarian: diff. between humanitarian aid and social justice obligations are not important. Utility does not respect natural boundaries.
  - Contractarian: people stand in a national community united by common acceptance of a concepiton of justice
- Criticisms of Rawls: principles ought to apply globally (universally), not just across the nation-state.

I: Rawls on International Justice
- Justice is the first virtue of social institutions.
- The primary subject of justice is the basic structure of society -- the way in which social institutions distribute fundametnal rights and duties and determine the division of advantages from social cooperation.
- If national boundaries are significant, then justice does not hold across people of different nationality.
- When we assume countries are interdependent, principles need to apply at a global level.
- The original position can be considered as a sort of international conference.
  - The law of nations for Rawls applies to a world of just states.
  - Original position is incomplete for international situations.
- Two elements for material advancement of society: cooperative activity and the natural component
  - Cooperative activity: subject to domestic principles of justice
  - Nautral component: morally relevant even without international cooperation

II: Natural Resources
- Natural resources are distributed unevenly
- Natural endowments are neither just nor unjust, but natural facts.
- An unjust society distributes the benefits of social cooperation according to a morally arbitrary criterion.
- Problems with Rawls' treatment of 'natural talents'
  - Unclear what morally arbitrary means
  - Natural talents are part of the self, and perhaps one's talents are protected by personal liberty consdierations.
- Parallel to resources:
  - Resource endowments are arbitrary in that they are not deserved
  - Unlike talents, resources are not attached to people
- Talents are what the self is -- they help constitute personality. But natural resources seem more oncintgent; not parts of the self to begin wtih, need to be appropriated first. Personal liberty claims do not apply in the same way.
- Natural distribution of resources is purer than a 'morally arbitrary' distribution fo talents.
- NO one has a naturally given prima facie claim to resources which 'happen' to be in their land
- Under the veil of ignorance, parties agree to an equitable resource redistribution principle
- What counts as a natural resource? Does food count as a natural resource? 

III
- So far, assumed that nations are self-sufficient cooperative schemes, but this is empirically untrue.
- Capital surpluses are reinvested in conditiosn which promise the highest yield. Value created in one part of the world benefits a richer part of the world.
- Poor countries lose political economy
- Economic interdependence involves largely nonvoluntary relationships
- National boundaries are not the outer limits of social cooperation -- this is empirically true.
- So do national boundaries have any fundametnal moral significance?
- National societies can no longer be viewed as ultimate
- Objections to Rawls applied at the global level seem not to hold up.
- Relations between nations appear more voluntary than relations between citizens in a state.

IV
- Rawls' derivation of principles of justice for the law of nations is incomplete -- neglected resource redistribution
- The self-sufficiency assumption is empricially unsupported.
- A state-centered image of the world loses its normative relevance in a globally economically interdependent world.
- What relevance do social ideals have for politics in the real world?
- Rawls: the natural duty of justice
- Ideal theory gives us criteria for formualting strategies of political action in the nonideal world
- In the nonideal world, the natural duty of justice may conflict with other duties
- Nonintervention vs commitment to protection of civil rights
- The contract doctrine can help us more from statist to global understandings of international justice

> For purposes of moral choice, we must, instead, regard the world from the perspective of an original position from which matters of national citizenship are excluded by an extended veil of ignorance

AI Provided Summary
- Section I: The author introduces the question of global justice and criticizes Rawls’ theory of justice for neglecting it. He argues that Rawls’ two principles of justice, which apply to domestic societies, do not adequately address the issues of international justice, such as the distribution of natural resources and the effects of economic interdependence. He suggests that Rawls’ brief remarks on the law of nations, which are based on a hypothetical international original position, are incomplete and unrealistic. He proposes to extend and modify Rawls’ theory to account for the moral implications of global social cooperation.
- Section II: The author reviews Rawls’ discussion of international justice and shows that it makes sense only on the empirical assumption that nation-states are self-sufficient. He then challenges this assumption and shows that it neglects certain problems about natural resources. He claims that the natural distribution of resources is morally arbitrary and requires redistribution under a resource redistribution principle. He compares this principle to the difference principle and the just savings principle in domestic societies.
- Section III: The author questions the empirical foundation of the self-sufficiency assumption and sketches the consequences for Rawlsian ideal theory of abandoning it. He argues that evidence of global economic and political interdependence shows the existence of a global scheme of social cooperation, which requires global principles of justice. He suggests that Rawls’ own two principles, suitably reinterpreted, could themselves be applied globally. He explains how the original position would be modified to reflect the global scope of social cooperation.
- Section IV: The author explores the relation of an ideal theory of international justice to some representative problems of politics in the nonideal world. He discusses how global principles would apply to cases involving unjust wars, human rights violations, foreign aid, and resource conservation. He acknowledges some difficulties and limitations of his approach and calls for further inquiry into the question of global justice.

## "Humanity and Justice in Global Perspective", Brian Barry (1982)

Three theses
- Considerations of humanity require rich countries to give aid to poor ones
- Considerations of justice require transfers from rich countries to poor ones
- Aid vs transfer: obligations imposed by humanity and justice are different, although not incompatible.

Humanity
- What would it mean to act in a humane way? A human act is beneficient.
- humanity -- the relief of distress.
- Three questions:
  1. Is it morally obligatory to behave humanely, or simply laudable?
  2. What implications does moral obligations have for the distribution of resources?
  3. On what criterion do we determine how much rich countries should give to poor ones?
- Indeed, there are duties of humanity (e.g. save the drowning child).
- Does the drowning child extent to international aid? Yes
  - Countries are responsible for their economic problems. But this does not mean that we should not help them, even if it is true, which it is likely not. 
  - SInger: neither proximity nor number of rescuers matters. Some objections: well proximity is just infeasible. But we should not contract the sphere of opertion because we can't do anything. Or maybe presence of other rescuers does matter. But if the child dorwns because none of the potential rescuers save it, all of them are morally responsible.
  - Argument of bureaucratic inefficiency: there will be a lot of waste. But what is left over will help a non-negliglbe amount. 
  - Neo-Malthusian argument: only effect is to lead to population increase and more suffering. But empriically this is not true.
  - Ideological and political dogmas can change, and we should not be under the illusion that they cannot (and hide behind it to withhold giving aid).
- How much aid is required?
  - One is obliged to help up to a point in which one sacrifices somehting of "comparable moral importance" -- maximizing consequentialism.
  - But do we really have an obligation to maximize the total amount of good in the universe?
  - There is no firm criterion for how much sacrifice is required. But there is a greater obligation the more severe the distress.
  - Kind of 'you know when you see it' answer as far as I estimate

Justice
- We should not expect to get a blueprint for a good society from a conception of justice.
- Obligation is not derived from justice
- Justice is a set of reasons why people may have duties to one another and institutions
- Justice as reciprocity
  - Justice as fidelity: keeping faith
  - Justice as requital: fair return / exchange
  - Jusitce as fair play: one should not be a free rider by taking the benefits. One can use the principle of fair play to rescue the drowning child without commiting oneself to a universal obligation of rescue. 
- Drowning child case is overdetermined when duty of fair play underwrites rescue: reinfrocement between humanity, fidelity and fiar play. 
  - Obligations to humanity do not depend on consdierations of reciprocity
- This is the Rawlsian entrance: society is a scheme of social cooperation from which we get the concepts of justice; but it only generates whatever its cooperative practices justice. Rawls can only say that a society suffers from collective irrationality but cannot cannot show a society is unjust.
- Charles Beitz argues for the global difference principle.
  - One cannot use a cooperative scheme to argue that it is unfair not to have more cooperation
  - The whole world does not constitute necessarily a single cooperative partnership
  - International redistribution does not necessarily help both rich and poor countries.
- Does trade constitute a cooperative scheme? Trade does not give rise to the duties of fair play per se -- it must be that public goods are collectively enjoyed. But there is no sort of shared unitization from trade.
  - Trade is, however, the rudimentary organs of international cooperation
  - Is there mutual beneficiality? Redistribution on the insurance principle has little appeal for rich countries
- Justice as Equal Rights
  - HLA Hart: are there any natural rights? Speical rights must presuppose general rights
  - Just as reciprocity needs rights to be assigned already.
  - The question is the initial injustice of rights.
  - The 'pre-predicative' distribution of rights is equal.
- The equality principle can be exploited by first-world countries to take third world countries'resources
- International institutions
  - Perfect Humean equilibrium: existence of redistributive institutions, beliefs on the legitimacy of redistribution -- organize each other.
  - The public sets the very terms of the conversation. (hmm... what is he really saying here?)
- International Taxation (24)
  - Two alternative approaches to a taxation scheme:
    - base taxes on both humanitarian and justice grounds
    - have comprehensive taxes and distribute proceeds among poor countries
  - Tax governments of rich countries and distribute to poor countries
  - GNP reflects use of irreplacable natural resources
  - Taxes not related to some aspect of justice should be rejected -- it's too arbitrary. This money should go straight to poor countries

The Relations Between Humanity and Justice
- Both humanity and justice require a substantial expansion in the scale of economic transfers
- Rationales are different, and so are practical implications.
- Rights and goals. Obligations of humanity are goal-based (aggregative); obligations of justice are rights-based (distributive)
- Humanity directs us to relieve suffering where it occurs -- concerned with well-being and fulfillment.
- Justice is concerned with the good and the bad states, and what responsibilities we have towards the former.
  - Subject matter: distribution of control over material resources
- Humanity is a question of doing good; justice is a question of power
- What is the difference between distribution of *stuff* against *welfare*?
- Justice is concerned with materials which support the material means of well-being.
  - Is justice then concerned with the goal of well-being? Is justice a derivative principle?
  - Two questions: What is the deployment of resources to promote happiness and reduce misery? What is the ethically defensible basis for allocating control over resources?
- Rich countries concede a humanitarian obligation to assist poor countries.
- Even with humanitarian aid, there is a division between donor countries free to spend 'their' incomes; donee countries must be 'responsible'
- Justice consideration transfers: reduce the resources of one set of countries, and add it to another set. So it is more about redistribution than anything -- about the power to even decide what humanitarian goals even mean for that country.
- If resources are justly owed to a country, then they are that country's, period.
- A world with an international authority which allows countries to keep income which is justly distributed internally rejects principles of national autonomy.
- The price of autonomy is the permission of waste.
- However we cannot have autonomy for some and Marxist supervision for tohers -- that would not be just.
- We cannot talk about humanity unless we have a baseline set by justice.  
- The need for humanitarian aid is reduced in a world which has a basically just international distribtuion.
