## July 5th
- Getting clear on Goodin
    - Goodin says "In the present world system, it is often-perhaps ordinarily-wrong to give priority to the claims of our compatriots." In what sense does this comport with his argument?
- Foucault and Marx -- Where do they fall here? How to square off continental and analytic philosophy?
    - Pogge: To what extent does this square off with what Marx is saying?
- How do Marx, Foucault, etc. fit into the matrix we've set up throughout class?
- Marxist/Foucauldian ethical systems or analytics
- Decolonial scholars? Gayatri Spivak, Edward Said, etc.
- Would it be fair to say that Miller is saying that we can't take the position of the subjectivity-less subject in the Rawlsian sense?
