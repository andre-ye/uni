## *Cartesian Meditations*, Husserl
Translated by Dorion Cairns

### Introduction
Decartes' Meditations as the prototype of philosophical reflection
- Decartes as France's greatest thinker
- Transcendental phenomenology as a neo-Cartesianism, even though it thoroughly rids itself of the doctrines of Cartesian philosophy
- *Meditationes de prima philosophia* -- a grounding of philosophy into a science
<!-- - Radical rebuilding of  -->

## *Phenomenology: The Basics*, Zahavi
### Introduction
- Phenomenology -- one of the most important traditions in 20th century philosophy
- Husserl, Heidegger, Srtre, Merleau-Ponty, Levinas. 
- Almost all subsequent German and French philosophy can be interpreted as an extension or reaction to phenomenology.
- Phenomenology is an important source of criticism

### Chapter 1: The Phenomenon
- Phenomenology: the study of phenomena -- but what is phenomenon?
- "Make philosophy out of cocktail"
- Everyday experience of simple objects is a point of departure for phenomenologists
- Reconnect with the richness of everyday life
  - Of course, the question -- what is 'everyday'
- Phenomenology is more interested in the how than the what of objects -- how does it appear (to a subject)?

The Alarm Clock
- An antique alarm clock in Copenhagen
- The alarm clock appears differently depending on its illumination.
- I will never see the entire alarm clock -- but it still only appears perspectivally
- The absent influences our perception: without the constitution of the back, the front we see is longer the front
- Perceptual experience is a play of presence and absence: we always experience more than what is simply given to us
- What we see is never in isolation
- There is no view from nowhere: only an embodied point of view. *The perceiver must be located in the same space occupied by the alarm clock.*
- Perceptual exploration
- Time is important in bodily exploration: the back does not go from mind even if from appearance.
- The alarm clock's appearance changes gradually: therefore our stream of consciousness must be temporally and experientially unified

Up to Appearance and Reality
- Phenomenology tells us about how phenomena *apparently* are.
- The phenomenon vs the noumenon
- To know what the object 'really is', the traditional notion is that we must go beyond the merely phenomenal.
- Heidegger: phenomenology invokes a different understanding of the phenomenon: the phenomenon is that which shows itself.
- PHenomenology is not a theory about the merely apparent: the phenomenon is something in itself.
- Two-world doctrine: world as it presents itself, vs. the world as it is in itself
  - Not a metaphysical split but rather, according to the phenomnologists, different modes of manifestation.
- Transcendentalism is rejected by phenomenologists
  - Abuse of the concept of reality
  - A defense of reality?
  - Objectivity is to be located in the appearing world

### Chapter 2: Intentionality
- What can I think about?
- Consciousness has a directedness -- intentionality
- Consciousness is self-transcending -- it points beyond itself
  - Interesting, because I suppose I would think recursive relations are the real transcending
- Connection between experiential subjectivity and worldly objects
- Consciousness is interested with objects and events different from consciousness itself
- We're never just conscious of an object in and of itself (simpliciter), but in a particular way
  - The same object can be intended in different ways. (What does this mean philosophically -- we are holding the object as first?)

Perception and Pictures
- We can be conscious of hypothetical objects -- we are directed towards the same object or type of object, but it shows itself in different ways.
- Intentional acts: linguistic (indirect), pictorial (indirect), perceptual (direct)
  - What does this mean? What if I am not referring to a particular object when I make use of indirect intention? What is the object here?
- Perceptional intentionality is more 'basic' than more complex form of intentionality. (This is potentially problematic in its logocentrism.)
- When I see a painting-portrait, I can observe the image-thing, the image-thing, and the image-subject. 
  - One object depicts another object!
  - Perceptory/appearance similarity does not imply otological similarity
  - In order to see what is depicted in a picture, we both have to see and not see what is in front of us
  - Peripheral awareness of the image-thing
  - Question: What is the ontological status of say, figures which I have only seen on television? How real are they if I have never experienced them directly? And why do I have faith that if I see Biden on MSNBC that it is the same Biden that I see on CNN or Fox?

Representation and Causality
- Intentionality of consicousness is a difficult situation
- Consciousness is outwards-directed
- How can the mind direct towards otherness?
- One idea: experiences are themselves subjective happenings. One needs to introduce an interface between the mind and the world to explain intentionality then. The cake affects my sensory apparatus and causes the mental representation to emerge for me.
- Rejected! Two criticisms
  - Representational mediation. Courts skepticism: why should awareness of an inner object enable awareness of an external object? We perceive an object first before its representational property.
  - Causal explanation. The physical dimension is not enough: when I look through binoculars, why don't I perceive the lenses of the binoculars? etc.: causality is too coarse to understand intentionality. It doesn't give us enough. Moreover, existing spatial objects constitute a small part of what I can be conscious of; what about absent objects, impossible objects, fictive objects?
- Perceptual experience is not an internal movie screen: perceptual experience gives us the object immediately; we do not need internal representation for experience.
  - Rather than representation, perception is presentation.
- The mind is not simply an object
- Clarifying the relation between the mind and the world

### Chapter 3: Methodological Considerations
- What is the phenomenological method?

Epoche and Reduction
- Certain methodological steps are required for understanding phenomenology
- We cannot be content with mere words, we must go back to things themselves.
  - Is this turning away from theories and interpretations?
- Bracketing or suspension (performance as epoche)
- Two interpretations of the epoche:
  - We have to bracket our existing ways of thinking. Let us turn back towards objects, and let the objects reveal themselves as what they are. (de-fetishize?)
  - We need to resituate ourselves from natural preoccupations with worldl objects. It reveals dimensions of our subjective lives.
- Both are mistaken: phenomenology is not a turn to the object or a return to the subject, but instead to investigate the interrelaltion between objects and subjects. 
- Another incorrect interpretation of phenomenology: phenomenology is a metaphilosophical or methodological approach rather than a metaphysical doctrine. The purpose is to limit the scope of investigation to experience; other issues are excluded.
- Heidegger: scientific ontology is nothing but phenomenology
- epoche is not the exclusion fo reality but a dogmatic attitude about reality which permeates scientific positivism.
  - Philosophy cannot assume natural realism; to prejudice the answer.
- We must suspend our belief in the mind-independent existence of the world.
- Epoche -- turning-away from natural human interests -- exclusion of a naive prejudice on the metaphysical status of the world.
  - Rediscover the relation between the mind and the world
- Following the epoche is the transcendental reduction: pay attention to what worldly objects are given -- we come to understand the relation between object and perceiver. The transcendental reduction is the systematic analysis of the correlation between subjectivity and the world
- Liberation from naturalistic dogmatism

Transcendental Philosophy
- Husserl affirms that he belongs to transcendental philosophy: not the disclosing of new factsbut rather in investigating the preconditions for reality. Why is objectivity possible in the first place?
- We continue to investigate the worldly object, but now not naively. Consciousness is not just object in but subject *for* the world
- Epoche / reduction are the preconditions for philosophically investigating reality.
- Heidegger: everyday existence is characterized by forgetting and objectification of the self
- Phenomenological analysis gives a certain violence.
- Tension between Husserlian and post-Husserlian phenomenologists

Up to Transcendental philosophy
