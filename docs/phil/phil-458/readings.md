## *Cartesian Meditations*, Husserl
Translated by Dorion Cairns

### Introduction
Decartes' Meditations as the prototype of philosophical reflection
- Decartes as France's greatest thinker
- Transcendental phenomenology as a neo-Cartesianism, even though it thoroughly rids itself of the doctrines of Cartesian philosophy
- *Meditationes de prima philosophia* -- a grounding of philosophy into a science, the need to bind philosophy to axioms
- Philosophy is a personal affair -- self acquired knowledge which "tends" towards the universal, to reason through knowledge.
- One of the first things one should reflect on when building a first philosophy is epistemology
- Decartes employs a regress to the ego as a subject of pure cogitationes (thinking process) through the method of doubt. Nothing is accepted as existent unless it cannot become doubtful. 
  - Decartes doubts sensuous experience and the natural world
  - Only the cogitationes has undoubtable existence; it cannot be doubtable
  - Decartes therefore is kind of solipsistic
  - How can we deduce an objective outwards? God, then Objective Nature.

The necessity of a radical new beginning of philosophy
- The positive sciences have paid very little attention to the meditations even though they find their grounding in it.
- The *Meditations* were epoch-making because it turned (back) to the pure ego cogito: from naive Objectivism to transcendental subjectivism
- The striving of transcendental subjectivism towards a 'necessary final form'
  - the fuck is "radical transmutation"?
- The decline of Western philosophy as a unitary science in the mid 1800s -- faith in 'autonomous philosophy' grew. But now it is falling too
- The semblance of pihlosophizing seriously -- pseudo-everything. The striving to produce objective results. But the philosophies do not share the same conceptual space
- Time to renew the radicality of the Carteisan overthrow
- Interesting that Husserl takes a historical approach here
- The radicality of philosophical self-responsibility: to be self-contained and true, to not fetishize itself, to be authentic and genuine. 

### First Meditation: The Way to the Transcendental Ego
The Cartesian overthrow and the guiding final idea of an absolute grounding of science
- The making of a new beginning: so we cannot start from existing sciences, we need a radically genuine science.
- Why this very idea that scince should be grounded absolutely? We cannot presuppose this
- Decartes presupposed the structure of science in his overthrow of science: we shall not so quickly accept the normative ideal of science
- We cannot even presuppose the possibility of an absolute grounding of science -- here Husserl is very cautious
- We will temporarily assume the general idea of science

Uncovering the final sense of science by becoming immersed in science qua noematic phenomenon
- The concept of science is not abstraction from the 'de facto sciences': the sciences involve a claim which is already satisfied. (What???)
- What is 'genuine science'?
- Judicative doing vs judgement
- Mediate judgements: believing presupposes beliving others
- Grounded judgements: showing the correctness or truth of the judgement
- The showing of the truth of the grounded judgement is itself mediate
- **Cognition** is the reactualizing and awareness of the truth in grounded judgeents
- **Evidence**: judgmeents show themselves to be correct; i.e. in agreement with the *judged* state of affairs.
  - Judging is meaning
  - When one has evidence, it is not merely believed, but apprehended or experienced. We have the state of affairs itself, not necessarily a representation. This gives evidence its pre-eminent judicative meaning.
- The scientist does not merely intend to judge, but to ground judgements: there must be a 'freely actualizable return to his repeatable act of grounding'-- this is what is meant by being apprehended, at hand
- Pre-predicative: prior to expression in language
- Judgement and evidence as being meant or viewed is different from a 'presymbolic' 'pre-predicative' state; being viewed means being given an expression in a language via prediction (something as a property of a subject). Evidence of the expression is an important part of scientific truth. ('second order', 'meta-')


Evidence and the idea of genuine science
- Evidence is a very broad sense -- experiencing of something which is ('mental seeing').
- Conflict with evidence is negative evidence as the form of a judgement ("positive evidence of the affair's non-being")
- Perfect evidence, pure & genuine truth: strivings of knowledge; science looks towards universal truths, which requires different verifications 'carried through to the end'
- **Science does not actualize absolute truths (even though it acts like it does), but rather modifies its "truths", tends towards improved approximations**
  - Science believes it can transcend itself
  - The idea of science requires beginning with a concept of the noumenal
- Everything which makes a philosophical beginning, we must acquire 'ourselves' 
  - How to make something out of nothign?
- First methodological principle: I cannot accpet any judgement as scientific which I have not derived from evidence (experiences) which make themselves apparent to me as themselves.
  - "It is plain that..." -- appeal to what, intuition?
- The sciences aim to symbolize what is held presymbolically (pre-predicatively)
- Now, a normative principle of evidence emerges and will be used henceforth
- A systematic order of cognitions. 

Differentiations of evidence. The philosophical demand for an evidence that is apodictic and first in itself.
- Absolute certainty / absolute indubitability
- The perfection of evidence becomes differentiated
- Perfection of prescientific experience/evidence, imperfection of incomplete experience (expectant meaning): perfecting is the filling of attendant meanings with actual experience.
- An apodicity as perfection -- even if evidence is inadequate
- What is apodicity? Evidence is a grasping of the 'it itself' (noumena?) "with full certainty of its being". With regular evidence, we may still become doubtful. Apodictic evidence, however, does let us do so: it discloses itself as being also the inconceivability of its nonbeing. i.e. necessary.
- If we have acquired this Cartesian principle of absolute indubitability, then we can build a science, an actual beginning. Well, can we bring out evidence which is apodictic, 'firstly in themselves'?

The evidence for the factual existence of the world is not apodietic; its inclusion in the Cartesian overthrow
- Does the existence of the world constitute apodictic evidence? Indeed, all sciences rely upon this.
- It seems so obvious that we don't need to assert it. However, our experiential evidence of the world also lacks apodicticity. The experienced thing may be an illusion of the senses; it could be a dream. Non-being is conceivable.
- We must criticize being in the world very much before using it as the basis for science.
- We cannot naively accept the sciences.
- But what can we do now, now that the world is no longer the basis for judgement?

The ego cogito as transcendental subjectivity
- Following Decartes, here is the reversal: the turn to the ego cogito as the ultimate apodictictally certain basis for judgement
- The world is something which claims being
- We should no longer speak in the plural: other men are the data of experience for me: I cannot use it. I lose formations of sociality and culture.
- My life is continually there *for me*: I can never doubt my own non-being, even if I choose to abstain from sensuou experiencing.
- I no longer naturally believe in the world
- But wait... even in the Ego's abstention from taking positions, they still appear in his field of experience. I have to presuppose the world to believe in my experience.
- We deprive the universe of acceptance: "putting out of play" of positions towards the Objective world -- the phenomenological epoche, pathenthesizing -- is not nihilistic or solipsistic, but rather what we get is my pure living and subjectivity, and the universe of phenomena
- I apprehend myself purely via epoche as ego: the Objective world exists for me as it is for me (i.e. accepted by me -- you perceive it experience it, judge it, remebmer it, etc.)
  - This is the Cartesian cogito
  - The world is the conscious cogito which comes from the cogitationes.
- *Natural being is secondary and presupposes the transcendental being.*
- The method of the transcendental epoche is transcendental-phenomenological reduction: it leads us back to transcendental being, to the pure ego and its cogitationes -- being that is prior in itself to all natural being in the world.

The range covered by apodictic evidence of the "I am"
- Does the reduction allow for apodictic evidence of the being of transcendental subjectivity?
- "I doubt" presupposes "I am"
- Doubt of the apodicity of the transcendental ego: what range does apodictic evidence cover?
- Adequacy and apodicity of evidence do not need to be equivalent. 
- What is the apodicity of memory?
- External perception is an experiencing of something itself. The physical thing has *for the experiencer* indefinitely generated horizon, which can be opened up by possible experiences.
- Similarly, the transcendental experience of the transcendental I-am has an indeterminate generality which can be opened up.
- How much can the transcendental ego deceive itself?

Digression: Decartes'failure to make the transcendental turn
- Decartes makes it easy to get hold of the pure ego and its cogitationes
- Much scholasticism lies in Decartes'*Meditations*
- We must stear clear of the "admiration" of natural science
- Decartes misses the point with transcendental realism by departing from the principle of evidence and accepting things which are not in the field of the ego cogito.

11 - The psychological and transcendental Ego. The transcendency of the World.
- If I keep only what comes to view for me via my epoche, I exist
- I do not find myself as a man in natural self experience: I am not Objective or positive or a psyche. Phenomenological epoche does not allow us to so quickly accept the Objective world
- By phenomenological epoche, I reduce my objective self to my transcnednetal-phenomenological Ego.
- This world derives its existential status from me as the existential Ego
- Transcendence is inherent to anything which is worldly

### Second Meditation: The Field of Transcendental Experience Laid Open in Respect of its Universal Structures

12 - The idea of a transcendental grounding of knowledge.
- What can I do with the transcendental ego?
- The being of the transcnedental ego is prior to all knowledge of the Objective sense; it is the basis for it
- A new idea of grounding knowledge -- of the transcnednetal ego as a grounding; let us perform the phenomenological epoche to understand transcendental experience
- What is the a priori science? (Philosophy)
- It is not just that "I am" is the only indubitable thing, but rather also the 'particular data' of self-experience -- the experiencable structure of the ego.

13 - Necessity of at first excluding problems relating to the range covered by transcnedental knowledge
- Criticizing transcendental self-experience
- Broadening of the Cartesian meditations
- Transcendental phenomenology, two stages:
  1. Explore the realm accessible to transcendental self-experience. Not yet fully scientific
  2. Criticism of transcendental experience and all transcendental cognition
- A science in contrast with the 'objective' sciences, a science of subjectivity (not objective subjectivity)
- Science can posit nothing but the ego and what is included in the ego itself
- Reduction to the transcendental ego seems solipsistic. However it leads towards a phenomenology of transcendental intersubjectivity.
- Cartesian evidence is barren -- the ego can explicate himself ad infinitum by means of transcendental experience
- We do not have to accept the existence of Objectivity, but we must accept the existence of experience

14 -- The stream of cogitationes. Cogito and cogitatum.
- From the ego cogito to the cogitationes -- the flowing of conscious life
- It is a mistake to take a psychological approach -- psychology is not transcendental phenomenology, because it does not necessitate the phenomenological reduction
- Epoche does not change the fact that that cogitationes 'bear the worldly' within themselves. Every conscious process is a consciousness *of* -- regardless of the 'objectivity' of the thing it is directed towards
- Ego cogito 'means' something or other, and bears in itself the cogitatum (the 'object' of cogitationes)
- Conscious processes are intentional
- A cogito always bears the cogitatum

15 -- Natural and transcendental reflection
- Straightforward grasping/perceiving vs reflections
- We might grasp the house, but not really the grasping in and of itself
- We already assume the world already exists
- In the transcendental-phenomenological reflection we doubt this via universal epoche: we look at the transcendentally reduced cogito
- Natural reflection: makes an object out of what it was previously
- Proper reflection is to consider what can be found in it
- What is a new intentional proces?
- Experiential knowing: Erfahrungswissen
- Reflecting experiencing is experiencing experiencing; flowing of subjective processes
- The Ego as a distinterested onlooker
- The Ego's interest is to see adn describe what he sees
- The universality of transcendental experience
- Noematic -- of the object being intended
- Noetic -- of the cogito itself
- We have not lost the world for phenomenology -- we retain it
- The universe continues to appear unitarily -- always a co-awareness of it, a unity of consciousness
- Whatever exists naturally exists only for me and by me.
- I have objects as the intentional correlates of modes of consciousness in them.

16 - Digression: Necessary beginning of both transcendental and purely pscyhological reflection within the ego cogito
- The ego cogito indicates an openly infinite multiplicity of concrete subjective processes
- The ego is concrete only in a connected intentional life
- Transcendental-descriptive egology has to begin with the ego cogito
- Separation between the cogito and the cogitatum qua cogitatum

17 - The two-sidedness of inquiry into consciousness as an investigation of correlatives. Lines of description. Synthesis as the primal form belonging to consciousness
- Synthesis -- I see that 'this' die is given continuously such that it appears to be the same thing throughout time.
- Each appearance is a synthetic unity
- Each passing cogito intends its cogitatum; the cogito has a 'structre of multiplicites'
- Facts of synthetic structure -- give noetic-noematic unity to single cogitationes
- Intentionality is the fundamental characteristic of psychic phenomena, Brentano

18 - Identification as the fundamental form of synthesis. The all-embracing synthesis of transcendental time.
- Identification -- a passively flowing synthesis.
- Every subjective process has its own temporality
- Unity of appearances is a unity of synthesis -- making one identical die, the connectedness of cogitationes
- The existence of the die is parenthesized in the epoche, but one identical appearing die is continuiously immanent in my consciousness.
- The object of consciousness is included in the subjective process; not necessarily some external imposition.
- We can intend the same die (for consciousness) many different ways.
- "Every consciousness in which the non-identical is intended unitarily is ultimately a synthesis in this sense"
- The whole of conscious life is unified synthetically; it is a cogito
- Fundamental form of universal synthesis is the consciousness of internal time; immanent and infinite time
- Modes of appearance are also intentive components of conscious life
- Relation between a viewer and itself.
- All of conscious life is unified synthetically.
- 'infinite regress'

19 -- Actuality and potentiality of intentional life
- The multiplicity of intentionality -- we can intend many different dimensions even as we experience them as one thing.
- Every actuality involves potentialities -- possibilities which are part of the subjective process and actualizable by the ego
- Every subjective process has a horizon
- Every perception has a reference to the 'genuine' object 
- Perception has horizons made of possibilities of perception -- what could we have intended if we directed our perception otherwise?
- This is stored in memroy in modified form
- Every perception is situated within a horizon of the past -- awakenable recollections
- Possible recollections might be actualized by "my initiative"
- Freedom is always open to possible interventions
- Horizons are 'predelineated potentialities'
- Cogitatum qua cogitatum is never present to actual consciousness
- There is a determinate structure to the indeterminacy of the predelineation of horizons: a die is the die in advance even though the particular determination is open -- there are multiple different forms an object can take on
- Leaving open is what makes the horizon
- Everyc onsciousness has the essential property not only to change into new modes of cnosciousness continuously on the same object (unity of synthesis) but doing so only according to the horizon intentionalities
- An object is a pole of identity -- having yet to be actualized, pointing towards a noetic intentionality

20 -- The peculiar nature of intentional analysis
- The analysis of consciousness must be distinguished from conventional anaysis.
- Conscious analysis is not just the data of consciousness into elements
- An uncovering of implicit potentialities in consciousness -- an unfolding of what is consciously meant.
- Intentional analysis
- Intending beyond itself as implicit in any consciousness -- I always mean more than the Same
- Phenomenologists do not naively devote themselves to understanding the intentioanl object (explicating its parts and properties); by doing so the noetic determinate multiplicities of consciousness remain hidden and unpenetrated
  - It is not just what is intended but also what is not intended but which could be intended
  - Consciousness makes clear an existing and determined object in it, but the phenomenologist includes also what is non-intituitively cointended.
  - The intentional reaches beyond isolated subjective processes which bring themselves to our intention. -- actual and potential subjective processes
- A new approach -- we concern ourselves with the subjective oranges.
- Intentional psychology -- Brentano. But failed to recognize the fundamental dimensions of the method
- There is no necessary determinism or fixedness to objects in consciousness; however, intentional analysis is still important; we can focus on the unity of consciousness in strict concepts

21 -- The intentional object as 'transcendental clue'
- The universal type -- ego, cogito, cogitatum; universal descriptions
- The particularization of a type
- The intentional object plays the role of the transcendental clue to the infinite multiplicites of possible cogitationes which, together in their synthesis, bear the intentional object
- An object given 'straightforwardly' -- the place of departure
- Formal universality -- any object can be thought of as cogitatum; we find the possible modes of consciousness fall into different types -- perception, retention, recollection, expectation, representation by analogy -- which apply to any conceivable objects
- Particularizing the 'empty universality' of the intentional obejct
  - Formal-logical/ontological: modes of anything (objct, universal, plurality, predicatively formed, etc.); objectivites which are real vs categorical objectivities
  - Material-ontological: beginning from a real individual which is differentiated into real reasons
- What is the noetic-noematic structure ofe ach type?
- The trask of transcendental theory is to articualte the set of structural tasks; belong together in a formally universal theory of any object and the horizon of all possible objects of consciousness
- Transcendental theories arise from relating to any spatial things ever; from the transcendental epoche.
- DIstinguishing the particular and the universal
- The world is a universal problem of egology

22 -- The idea of the universal unity comprising all objects, and the task of clarifying it constitutionally
- Types of objects viewed purelya s cogitata are clues for transcendental investigations
- Multiplicities of consciousness belong together for essential reasons
- An 'Objective' object has a structure in the transcendental ego governed by a rule
- The object indicates a universal rule governing possible other consciousnesses as identical, for every imaginable object
- The all-ness of objects and types of objects are graspable by me as the transcendental ego 
- A universal constitutive synthesis -- all syntheses function together in an ordered manner; all actual and possible objectivities are embraced; the trask of transcendental phenomenology is to carry out phenomenological investigations within this unity

Key Points
- The transcendental ego is prior to so-called Objective knowledge. Moreover, It is not only that "I am" is apodictic, but also the experiencable structure of the ego
- Psychology is not transcendental phenomenology but parallel to it, because it conceives of consciousness as an object from outside  whereas first phenomenology understands the outside is always constructed from inside
- Conscious processes are always intentional; a cogito always has a cogitatum. There can never be a consciousness in a void which is not directed at intending something.
- All objects are formed as synthesis (a fundamental movement) and cointended with other intentions; appearances are always compossible; we must in our analysis not only consider what is directly given to us in terms of features and traditional analysis but consider the holistic presence and absence which together form a universal unity of consciousness.

Questions
- Is there an assumption of some concept of free will here which precedes my perception? How does, if at all, an unexplained concept of choice operate here? Does it hinder the efficacy of the argument?
- Does phenomenological analysis apply to a non-human ego; i.e. an animal which can ostensibly experience but perhaps which cannot articualte that experience?
- Is apodicticity apodictic; that is, it is self-evident that self-evidence is self-evidently necessary? Is it possible for us to really run away from transcendental constitution? Does Husserl later on make unapodictic conclusions, such as the question of multiplicities and synthesis? What is the 'reality' or 'apodicticity' of these conclusions?
- What is the relation between the process of arriving at a statement and its apodicticity? Is the history of an object necessarily inscribed upon the ontological status of that object?

### Third Meditation: Constitutional Problems. Truth and actuality

23 -- A more pregnant concept of constitution, under the titles 'reason' and 'unreason'.
- Phenomenological constitution has been the constitutional of whatever intentional object whatever -- full, broad, unrestrained, universal within the phenomenological frame.
- 'pregnant concepts of constitution'
- Are the objects in question truly exsitent/possible?
- Reason and unreason, being and non-being
- Epoche, we reduce to pure meaning -- cogito. 
- Truth 
- Consicousness can be explored as the synthesis of multiplicities
- Reason -- a title for an essentially necessary structural form in all transcendental subjectivity
- Reason -- possibilities of verification (!!!) -- making evident, having asevident

24 -- Evidence as itself-givenness and the modifications of evidence
- Evidence -- primal phenomenon of intentional life
- The Ego which signifies not at something but with itself
- Evidence is experienc ein a maximally broad yet essentially unitary sense
- Evidence points towards a fundamental trait of intentional life -- consciousness is either already evidence or tends towards variants, in "I can"
- TO what extent does the meant object correspond to consciousness? How odes it look 'it itself'?
- Verification can become negative -- character of nullity
- Non-being is a mode of being

25 -- Actuality and quasi-actuality
- Possibility -- imaginableness
- Non-actualities -- not belonging to actuality
- Correlativity, modes of consciousness - divided into positionality and quasi-positionality (as if, fantasizing)
- Clarification -- making clear is a mode of making evident. 

26 -- Actuality as the correlate of evident verification
- A universal conformity to laws on structure by conscious life
- Regularity of truth and actuality
- Objects exist for me -- well, but this only says that objects are accepted by me
- Something is actual by virtue of a synthesis of evident verification; the truth of objects is obtained only from evidence; it is only by evidence that any sort of actual existing has sense for us. 

27 -- Habitual and potential evidence as functioning constitutively for the sense 'existing object'. 
- Ideal immanence -- complex of possible syntheses. Every evidence sets up for me a possession -- I can return 
- Evidence of immanent data
- Potentiality and possibility
- Particular evidence does not give us any abiding being by itself; everything which exists (for me) is in itself (for me); and every truth is likewise a truth (for me) in itself (for me)
- Repeatability of evidence and experience
- Potentiality of infinite intendings

28 -- Presumptive evidence of world-experience. World as an idea correlative to a perfect experiential evidence
- Objects are given to us with a necessary one-sidedness
- Objects in the real Objective world are "external experience" -- there is not only a physical but also a philosophical one-sidedness" to external experience: a horizon of unfilled anticipations which refer us to potential evidence
- Actualizing synthetic transitions from evidence to evidence -- it is the synthesis which actualizes the thing, the identified thing
- Syntheses must always involve expectant and unfulfilled meanings 

29 -- Material and formal ontological regions as indexes pointing to transcendental systems of evidence
- Ego's self-explication: true being indicates a structural differentiation among infinite multiplicities ofa ctual and possible cogitationes
- Actually existing objects point towards some particularity in this multiplicity, where evidences relating to the object combine to make up total evidence -- perfect evidence
- Problem of transcendental constitution of existing objectivity ('pregnant constitution')
- Beyond formally universal investigations -- what is the Objective world? Physical Nature is given to man: naive ontological concepts like real space, real time, real causality, real physicality, etc. We have to uncover the intentionality implicit in this experience itself, of course. But there are very complicated correlations and syntheses. Subjective objects ascend or 'emerge from' a 'lower' objective basis (the apodictic)

Key Points
- Evidence is experience in a very broad but fundamentally unitary sense: evidence is what is directly given to us in experience. Consciousness is already itself evidence or tends towards variants of evidence. Consciousness actualizes synthetic transitions from evidence to evidence to constitute continuous identification of an object.
- The truth of objects is obtained only from evidence, and only by evidence that actual existing can itself have any sense for us. Objects are accepted by me via this synthesis of evident verification.
- Syntheses always involve expectant and unfulfilled meanings. Along with every actuality is a potentiality which shows what is in excess of the actuality such that the actuality may appear as an object. We continually fulfill these expectant meanings through our protention.

Questions
- In what sense does the concept of the object precede evidence of the object? I can only perceive an evidence *of* if I have already established the ideal infinite multitude of the Object which remains expectant to possible actualizations. I might just 'see' the environment 'in general' (although this is itself a good question); but I will never 'turn the apple in my hand and perceive its various sides' without first constituting at least some vague concept of the apple.
- To what extent really is possibility the possiiblity of actualization? Can an object have in itself possibility which has no hope of actualization?
- Can one actualize things by their own free will, and in that sense how 'given' is that thing? If I consciously think of traveling at infinite speed, have I actualized it even though it is "physically impossible"? Is there a difference between thinking about traveling at infinite speed and traveling at 100 km/h, in that both are theoretical intendings, but one is 'physically impossible', whatever that means?

### Fourth Meditation: Development of the Constitutional Problems Pertaining to the Transcendental Ego himself

30 -- The transcendental ego is inseparable from the processes making up his life.
- Objects exist for me and are for me what they are
- What makes up concretely the existence of m consciousness?
- every object the ego means, thinks of, deals with, etc. exists as the correlate of its system; indicates a correlative system
- The ego 

31 -- The Ego as identical pole of the subjective processes
- The ego is existent for himself in continuous evidence -- he continuously constitutes himself as existing. 
- We have looked at the flowing cogito
- What about a second kind of synthesis, which embraces not identical obejcts but a multiplicity of cogitrationes
- What is the identical Ego whicih lives in all processes of consciousness?

32 -- The Ego as substrate of habitualities
- The Ego is not an 'empty' pole of identity
- Ego as both a subject and an object
- When I accept my act, I can return to it and find it as mine -- 'act-process vanishes but the decision persists' -- I am so decided, I keep my decision.
- I am changed if I 'cancel' my decisions
- The Ego becomes the identical substract of Ego-properties -- the ego acquires a 'personal character'

33 -- The full concretion of the Ego as monad and the problem of his self-constitution
- The ego taken in full concreteness: the monad (Leibniz)
- As an ego, I have a surrouding world -- 'my world', everything which exists 'for me'
- Ego taken in full concreteness 
- That without the ego cannot be concrete
- The ego has a surrounding world which 'exists for them' -- objects which I have experienced and which I am going to be aquainted with.
- I ocnstitute the object in its "explicit sense form" -- "something identical having its manifold properties"; the object's "manifold determinations" are "mine"
- *Objects are anticipated by the formal object-structure*
- I exist for myself, am given for myself, by experiential evidence
- How do phenomenologically explicate the monadic ego? Phenomenology as a whole coincides with the concept of self-constitution

34 -- A fundamental development of phenomenological method. Transcendental analysis as eidetic. 
- Ego as the pole of his acts
- *Genetic phenomenology*
- The methodological insight which pervades all of the phenomenological method.
- There is a great multiplicity (excessively so) of discoveries -- *eidetic description* helps us understand the fundamental dimension of empirical descriptions
- Through my meditations, I am able to intentionally uncover the processes constituting my monad.
- Types of occurrences in the transcendental ego have "empirical" significance (???)
- Let us vary our perception of the table: without accepting its being. We shift 'actual perception' into the 'world of non-actuality' (possibility) (why does Husserl think that this is possible?)
- Perception 'floats in the air' -- pure eidos perception (doubtful...)
- To find the essence of free variation -- the universal essence
  - Private note -- is this not what deep learning models do?
- Eidos is a pure unconditioned universal, and is prior to all concepts; pure concepts must fit the eidos
  - Again, what??? Asserting a-apodictic priori statements?
- Each type is elevated into a pure eidetic sphere
- Freely varying the ego, we become an eidos ego, purely possible ego, pure possibility of my 'de facto ego'.
- Eidetic pheonmenology allows us to understand the universal A-priori (the constants of perception?)
- We have to devleop a purely eidetic phenomenology
- The science of pure possibilities precedes the science of actualities and *makes it possible*
- Eidetic intuition is fundamental among transcendental methods

35 -- Excursus into eidetic internal psychology
- Psychology as a positive science needs first a purely intentional psychology
- I as a pole of my habitualities
- Eidetic pure psychology -- understanding the eidos psyche

36 -- The transcednental ego as the universe of possible forms of subjective process. The compossibility of subjective processes in coexistence or succession as subject to eidetic laws.
- We confine ourselves to purely eidetic phenomenology
- Actually trying to deal with the essential dimensions is very difficult
- My rational activity changes who "I" am -- man presents itslef in efficient form from my habitualities
- I constitute myself for myself

37 -- Time as the universal form of all egological genisis
- All eidetic laws of compossibility are laws of causality

Questions
- Does Husserl's description of the ego allow computers to theoretically become an ego? Is there something which needs to be 'natural' or 'human' about the syntheses which become habitualized into the monad of me?

## *Phenomenology: The Basics*, Zahavi
### Introduction
- Phenomenology -- one of the most important traditions in 20th century philosophy
- Husserl, Heidegger, Srtre, Merleau-Ponty, Levinas. 
- Almost all subsequent German and French philosophy can be interpreted as an extension or reaction to phenomenology.
- Phenomenology is an important source of criticism

### Chapter 1: The Phenomenon
- Phenomenology: the study of phenomena -- but what is phenomenon?
- "Make philosophy out of cocktail"
- Everyday experience of simple objects is a point of departure for phenomenologists
- Reconnect with the richness of everyday life
  - Of course, the question -- what is 'everyday'
- Phenomenology is more interested in the how than the what of objects -- how does it appear (to a subject)?

The Alarm Clock
- An antique alarm clock in Copenhagen
- The alarm clock appears differently depending on its illumination.
- I will never see the entire alarm clock -- but it still only appears perspectivally
- The absent influences our perception: without the constitution of the back, the front we see is longer the front
- Perceptual experience is a play of presence and absence: we always experience more than what is simply given to us
- What we see is never in isolation
- There is no view from nowhere: only an embodied point of view. *The perceiver must be located in the same space occupied by the alarm clock.*
- Perceptual exploration
- Time is important in bodily exploration: the back does not go from mind even if from appearance.
- The alarm clock's appearance changes gradually: therefore our stream of consciousness must be temporally and experientially unified

Up to Appearance and Reality
- Phenomenology tells us about how phenomena *apparently* are.
- The phenomenon vs the noumenon
- To know what the object 'really is', the traditional notion is that we must go beyond the merely phenomenal.
- Heidegger: phenomenology invokes a different understanding of the phenomenon: the phenomenon is that which shows itself.
- Phenomenology is not a theory about the merely apparent: the phenomenon is something in itself.
- Two-world doctrine: world as it presents itself, vs. the world as it is in itself
  - Not a metaphysical split but rather, according to the phenomnologists, different modes of manifestation.
- Transcendentalism is rejected by phenomenologists
  - Abuse of the concept of reality
  - A defense of reality?
  - Objectivity is to be located in the appearing world

### Chapter 2: Intentionality
- What can I think about?
- Consciousness has a directedness -- intentionality
- Consciousness is self-transcending -- it points beyond itself
  - Interesting, because I suppose I would think recursive relations are the real transcending
- Connection between experiential subjectivity and worldly objects
- Consciousness is interested with objects and events different from consciousness itself
- We're never just conscious of an object in and of itself (simpliciter), but in a particular way
  - The same object can be intended in different ways. (What does this mean philosophically -- we are holding the object as first?)

Perception and Pictures
- We can be conscious of hypothetical objects -- we are directed towards the same object or type of object, but it shows itself in different ways.
- Intentional acts: linguistic (indirect), pictorial (indirect), perceptual (direct)
  - What does this mean? What if I am not referring to a particular object when I make use of indirect intention? What is the object here?
- Perceptional intentionality is more 'basic' than more complex form of intentionality. (This is potentially problematic in its logocentrism.)
- When I see a painting-portrait, I can observe the image-thing, the image-thing, and the image-subject. 
  - One object depicts another object!
  - Perceptory/appearance similarity does not imply otological similarity
  - In order to see what is depicted in a picture, we both have to see and not see what is in front of us
  - Peripheral awareness of the image-thing
  - Question: What is the ontological status of say, figures which I have only seen on television? How real are they if I have never experienced them directly? And why do I have faith that if I see Biden on MSNBC that it is the same Biden that I see on CNN or Fox?

Representation and Causality
- Intentionality of consicousness is a difficult situation
- Consciousness is outwards-directed
- How can the mind direct towards otherness?
- One idea: experiences are themselves subjective happenings. One needs to introduce an interface between the mind and the world to explain intentionality then. The cake affects my sensory apparatus and causes the mental representation to emerge for me.
- Rejected! Two criticisms
  - Representational mediation. Courts skepticism: why should awareness of an inner object enable awareness of an external object? We perceive an object first before its representational property.
  - Causal explanation. The physical dimension is not enough: when I look through binoculars, why don't I perceive the lenses of the binoculars? etc.: causality is too coarse to understand intentionality. It doesn't give us enough. Moreover, existing spatial objects constitute a small part of what I can be conscious of; what about absent objects, impossible objects, fictive objects?
- Perceptual experience is not an internal movie screen: perceptual experience gives us the object immediately; we do not need internal representation for experience.
  - Rather than representation, perception is presentation.
- The mind is not simply an object
- Clarifying the relation between the mind and the world

### Chapter 3: Methodological Considerations
- What is the phenomenological method?

Epoche and Reduction
- Certain methodological steps are required for understanding phenomenology
- We cannot be content with mere words, we must go back to things themselves.
  - Is this turning away from theories and interpretations?
- Bracketing or suspension (performance as epoche)
- Two interpretations of the epoche:
  - We have to bracket our existing ways of thinking. Let us turn back towards objects, and let the objects reveal themselves as what they are. (de-fetishize?)
  - We need to resituate ourselves from natural preoccupations with worldl objects. It reveals dimensions of our subjective lives.
- Both are mistaken: phenomenology is not a turn to the object or a return to the subject, but instead to investigate the interrelaltion between objects and subjects. 
- Another incorrect interpretation of phenomenology: phenomenology is a metaphilosophical or methodological approach rather than a metaphysical doctrine. The purpose is to limit the scope of investigation to experience; other issues are excluded.
- Heidegger: scientific ontology is nothing but phenomenology
- epoche is not the exclusion fo reality but a dogmatic attitude about reality which permeates scientific positivism.
  - Philosophy cannot assume natural realism; to prejudice the answer.
- We must suspend our belief in the mind-independent existence of the world.
- Epoche -- turning-away from natural human interests -- exclusion of a naive prejudice on the metaphysical status of the world.
  - Rediscover the relation between the mind and the world
- Following the epoche is the transcendental reduction: pay attention to what worldly objects are given -- we come to understand the relation between object and perceiver. The transcendental reduction is the systematic analysis of the correlation between subjectivity and the world
- Liberation from naturalistic dogmatism

Transcendental Philosophy
- Husserl affirms that he belongs to transcendental philosophy: not the disclosing of new factsbut rather in investigating the preconditions for reality. Why is objectivity possible in the first place?
- We continue to investigate the worldly object, but now not naively. Consciousness is not just object in but subject *for* the world
- Epoche / reduction are the preconditions for philosophically investigating reality.
- Heidegger: everyday existence is characterized by forgetting and objectification of the self
- Phenomenological analysis gives a certain violence.
- Tension between Husserlian and post-Husserlian phenomenologists

Up to Transcendental philosophy

## Office Hours Questions

- Have a passing interest in Derrida, Lacan, semiotics/post-structuralism. So I'm especially interested in the role that the sign plays in phenomenology
- The question of evidence -- really clarifying it.
  - Is evidence always 'evidence of', just like consciousness is always 'consciousness of'?
  - If so, then the acceptance of the concept of the object necessarily precedes the evidence of it?
  - Consicousness is always directed -- so I can't just experience the world 'in its entirety'.
  - Husserl: "Abstaining from acceptance of its being" while doing eidetic variation, where we are shifting our perspective of the table -- don't you already need to have accepted the being of the table, at least for you, in order for you to do eidetic variation to begin with?
- Reproducing the problem of the bridge just within the phenomenal experiential world. It seems like what Husserl is trying to do is to assert that behind the phenomena of our phenomena (predicative judgements) are the noumena of the phenomena (pre-predicative judgements) which we don't directly experience but can infer somehow.
  - The sense-form on page 80 in the PDF
- Linguistic objection to the "I think, therefore I am" -- the extent to which concepts are tracked upon and not independent of the language they are articulated in? If I accept the language system given, then yes "I think, therefore I am" -- but this then isn't apodictic because it is contingent, and I can doubt that the conditions for that contingency.
  - The indubidability of "I doubt that I am" implies "I am" -- well, why? I can entirely doubt it by not adhering to the symbolic rule that the "I" in "I am" is the "I" in "I doubt". 
  - Being and thinking -- attached to the subject. I can change the nature of the subject.
  - To what extent do statements exist independently of their statements?
- What is the role of freedom and agency in experience? To what extent does the ego create the world that it experiences?
- What does it even mean to doubt?
