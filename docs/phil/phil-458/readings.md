## *Cartesian Meditations*, Husserl
Translated by Dorion Cairns

### Introduction
Decartes' Meditations as the prototype of philosophical reflection
- Decartes as France's greatest thinker
- Transcendental phenomenology as a neo-Cartesianism, even though it thoroughly rids itself of the doctrines of Cartesian philosophy
- *Meditationes de prima philosophia* -- a grounding of philosophy into a science, the need to bind philosophy to axioms
- Philosophy is a personal affair -- self acquired knowledge which "tends" towards the universal, to reason through knowledge.
- One of the first things one should reflect on when building a first philosophy is epistemology
- Decartes employs a regress to the ego as a subject of pure cogitationes (thinking process) through the method of doubt. Nothing is accepted as existent unless it cannot become doubtful. 
  - Decartes doubts sensuous experience and the natural world
  - Only the cogitationes has undoubtable existence; it cannot be doubtable
  - Decartes therefore is kind of solipsistic
  - How can we deduce an objective outwards? God, then Objective Nature.

The necessity of a radical new beginning of philosophy
- The positive sciences have paid very little attention to the meditations even though they find their grounding in it.
- The *Meditations* were epoch-making because it turned (back) to the pure ego cogito: from naive Objectivism to transcendental subjectivism
- The striving of transcendental subjectivism towards a 'necessary final form'
  - the fuck is "radical transmutation"?
- The decline of Western philosophy as a unitary science in the mid 1800s -- faith in 'autonomous philosophy' grew. But now it is falling too
- The semblance of pihlosophizing seriously -- pseudo-everything. The striving to produce objective results. But the philosophies do not share the same conceptual space
- Time to renew the radicality of the Carteisan overthrow
- Interesting that Husserl takes a historical approach here
- The radicality of philosophical self-responsibility: to be self-contained and true, to not fetishize itself, to be authentic and genuine. 

### First Meditation: The Way to the Transcendental Ego
The Cartesian overthrow and the guiding final idea of an absolute grounding of science
- The making of a new beginning: so we cannot start from existing sciences, we need a radically genuine science.
- Why this very idea that scince should be grounded absolutely? We cannot presuppose this
- Decartes presupposed the structure of science in his overthrow of science: we shall not so quickly accept the normative ideal of science
- We cannot even presuppose the possibility of an absolute grounding of science -- here Husserl is very cautious
- We will temporarily assume the general idea of science

Uncovering the final sense of science by becoming immersed in science qua noematic phenomenon
- The concept of science is not abstraction from the 'de facto sciences': the sciences involve a claim which is already satisfied. (What???)
- What is 'genuine science'?
- Judicative doing vs judgement
- Mediate judgements: believing presupposes beliving others
- Grounded judgements: showing the correctness or truth of the judgement
- The showing of the truth of the grounded judgement is itself mediate
- **Cognition** is the reactualizing and awareness of the truth in grounded judgeents
- **Evidence**: judgmeents show themselves to be correct; i.e. in agreement with the *judged* state of affairs.
  - Judging is meaning
  - When one has evidence, it is not merely believed, but apprehended or experienced. We have the state of affairs itself, not necessarily a representation. This gives evidence its pre-eminent judicative meaning.
- The scientist does not merely intend to judge, but to ground judgements: there must be a 'freely actualizable return to his repeatable act of grounding'-- this is what is meant by being apprehended, at hand
- Pre-predicative: prior to expression in language
- Judgement and evidence as being meant or viewed is different from a 'presymbolic' 'pre-predicative' state; being viewed means being given an expression in a language via prediction (something as a property of a subject). Evidence of the expression is an important part of scientific truth. ('second order', 'meta-')


Evidence and the idea of genuine science
- Evidence is a very broad sense -- experiencing of something which is ('mental seeing').
- Conflict with evidence is negative evidence as the form of a judgement ("positive evidence of the affair's non-being")
- Perfect evidence, pure & genuine truth: strivings of knowledge; science looks towards universal truths, which requires different verifications 'carried through to the end'
- **Science does not actualize absolute truths (even though it acts like it does), but rather modifies its "truths", tends towards improved approximations**
  - Science believes it can transcend itself
  - The idea of science requires beginning with a concept of the noumenal
- Everything which makes a philosophical beginning, we must acquire 'ourselves' 
  - How to make something out of nothign?
- First methodological principle: I cannot accpet any judgement as scientific which I have not derived from evidence (experiences) which make themselves apparent to me as themselves.
  - "It is plain that..." -- appeal to what, intuition?
- The sciences aim to symbolize what is held presymbolically (pre-predicatively)
- Now, a normative principle of evidence emerges and will be used henceforth
- A systematic order of cognitions. 

Differentiations of evidence. The philosophical demand for an evidence that is apodictic and first in itself.
- Absolute certainty / absolute indubitability
- The perfection of evidence becomes differentiated
- Perfection of prescientific experience/evidence, imperfection of incomplete experience (expectant meaning): perfecting is the filling of attendant meanings with actual experience.
- An apodicity as perfection -- even if evidence is inadequate
- What is apodicity? Evidence is a grasping of the 'it itself' (noumena?) "with full certainty of its being". With regular evidence, we may still become doubtful. Apodictic evidence, however, does let us do so: it discloses itself as being also the inconceivability of its nonbeing. i.e. necessary.
- If we have acquired this Cartesian principle of absolute indubitability, then we can build a science, an actual beginning. Well, can we bring out evidence which is apodictic, 'firstly in themselves'?

The evidence for the factual existence of the world is not apodietic; its inclusion in the Cartesian overthrow
- Does the existence of the world constitute apodictic evidence? Indeed, all sciences rely upon this.
- It seems so obvious that we don't need to assert it. However, our experiential evidence of the world also lacks apodicticity. The experienced thing may be an illusion of the senses; it could be a dream. Non-being is conceivable.
- We must criticize being in the world very much before using it as the basis for science.
- We cannot naively accept the sciences.
- But what can we do now, now that the world is no longer the basis for judgement?

The ego cogito as transcendental subjectivity
- Following Decartes, here is the reversal: the turn to the ego cogito as the ultimate apodictictally certain basis for judgement
- The world is something which claims being
- We should no longer speak in the plural: other men are the data of experience for me: I cannot use it. I lose formations of sociality and culture.
- My life is continually there *for me*: I can never doubt my own non-being, even if I choose to abstain from sensuou experiencing.
- I no longer naturally believe in the world
- But wait... even in the Ego's abstention from taking positions, they still appear in his field of experience. I have to presuppose the world to believe in my experience.
- We deprive the universe of acceptance: "putting out of play" of positions towards the Objective world -- the phenomenological epoche, pathenthesizing -- is not nihilistic or solipsistic, but rather what we get is my pure living and subjectivity, and the universe of phenomena
- I apprehend myself purely via epoche as ego: the Objective world exists for me as it is for me (i.e. accepted by me -- you perceive it experience it, judge it, remebmer it, etc.)
  - This is the Cartesian cogito
  - The world is the conscious cogito which comes from the cogitationes.
- *Natural being is secondary and presupposes the transcendental being.*
- The method of the transcendental epoche is transcendental-phenomenological reduction: it leads us back to transcendental being, to the pure ego and its cogitationes -- being that is prior in itself to all natural being in the world.

The range covered by apodictic evidence of the "I am"
- Does the reduction allow for apodictic evidence of the being of transcendental subjectivity?
- "I doubt" presupposes "I am"
- Doubt of the apodicity of the transcendental ego: what range does apodictic evidence cover?
- Adequacy and apodicity of evidence do not need to be equivalent. 
- What is the apodicity of memory?
- External perception is an experiencing of something itself. The physical thing has *for the experiencer* indefinitely generated horizon, which can be opened up by possible experiences.
- Similarly, the transcendental experience of the transcendental I-am has an indeterminate generality which can be opened up.
- How much can the transcendental ego deceive itself?

Digression: Decartes'failure to make the transcendental turn
- Decartes makes it easy to get hold of the pure ego and its cogitationes
- Much scholasticism lies in Decartes'*Meditations*
- We must stear clear of the "admiration" of natural science
- Decartes misses the point with transcendental realism by departing from the principle of evidence and accepting things which are not in the field of the ego cogito.

11 - The psychological and transcendental Ego. The transcendency of the World.
- If I keep only what comes to view for me via my epoche, I exist
- I do not find myself as a man in natural self experience: I am not Objective or positive or a psyche. Phenomenological epoche does not allow us to so quickly accept the Objective world
- By phenomenological epoche, I reduce my objective self to my transcnednetal-phenomenological Ego.
- This world derives its existential status from me as the existential Ego
- Transcendence is inherent to anything which is worldly

### Second Meditation: The Field of Transcendental Experience Laid Open in Respect of its Universal Structures

12 - The idea of a transcendental grounding of knowledge.
- What can I do with the transcendental ego?
- The being of the transcnedental ego is prior to all knowledge of the Objective sense; it is the basis for it
- A new idea of grounding knowledge -- of the transcnednetal ego as a grounding; let us perform the phenomenological epoche to understand transcendental experience
- What is the a priori science? (Philosophy)
- It is not just that "I am" is the only indubitable thing, but rather also the 'particular data' of self-experience -- the experiencable structure of the ego.

13 - Necessity of at first excluding problems relating to the range covered by transcnedental knowledge
- Criticizing transcendental self-experience
- Broadening of the Cartesian meditations
- Transcendental phenomenology, two stages:
  1. Explore the realm accessible to transcendental self-experience. Not yet fully scientific
  2. Criticism of transcendental experience and all transcendental cognition
- A science in contrast with the 'objective' sciences, a science of subjectivity (not objective subjectivity)
- Science can posit nothing but the ego and what is included in the ego itself
- Reduction to the transcendental ego seems solipsistic. However it leads towards a phenomenology of transcendental intersubjectivity.
- Cartesian evidence is barren -- the ego can explicate himself ad infinitum by means of transcendental experience
- We do not have to accept the existence of Objectivity, but we must accept the existence of experience

14 -- The stream of cogitationes. Cogito and cogitatum.
- From the ego cogito to the cogitationes -- the flowing of conscious life
- It is a mistake to take a psychological approach -- psychology is not transcendental phenomenology, because it does not necessitate the phenomenological reduction
- Epoche does not change the fact that that cogitationes 'bear the worldly' within themselves. Every conscious process is a consciousness *of* -- regardless of the 'objectivity' of the thing it is directed towards
- Ego cogito 'means' something or other, and bears in itself the cogitatum (the 'object' of cogitationes)
- Conscious processes are intentional
- A cogito always bears the cogitatum

15 -- Natural and transcendental reflection
- Straightforward grasping/perceiving vs reflections
- We might grasp the house, but not really the grasping in and of itself
- We already assume the world already exists
- In the transcendental-phenomenological reflection we doubt this via universal epoche: we look at the transcendentally reduced cogito
- Natural reflection: makes an object out of what it was previously
- Proper reflection is to consider what can be found in it
- What is a new intentional proces?
- Experiential knowing: Erfahrungswissen
- Reflecting experiencing is experiencing experiencing; flowing of subjective processes
- The Ego as a distinterested onlooker
- The Ego's interest is to see adn describe what he sees
- The universality of transcendental experience
- Noematic -- of the object being intended
- Noetic -- of the cogito itself
- We have not lost the world for phenomenology -- we retain it
- The universe continues to appear unitarily -- always a co-awareness of it, a unity of consciousness
- Whatever exists naturally exists only for me and by me.
- I have objects as the intentional correlates of modes of consciousness in them.

## *Phenomenology: The Basics*, Zahavi
### Introduction
- Phenomenology -- one of the most important traditions in 20th century philosophy
- Husserl, Heidegger, Srtre, Merleau-Ponty, Levinas. 
- Almost all subsequent German and French philosophy can be interpreted as an extension or reaction to phenomenology.
- Phenomenology is an important source of criticism

### Chapter 1: The Phenomenon
- Phenomenology: the study of phenomena -- but what is phenomenon?
- "Make philosophy out of cocktail"
- Everyday experience of simple objects is a point of departure for phenomenologists
- Reconnect with the richness of everyday life
  - Of course, the question -- what is 'everyday'
- Phenomenology is more interested in the how than the what of objects -- how does it appear (to a subject)?

The Alarm Clock
- An antique alarm clock in Copenhagen
- The alarm clock appears differently depending on its illumination.
- I will never see the entire alarm clock -- but it still only appears perspectivally
- The absent influences our perception: without the constitution of the back, the front we see is longer the front
- Perceptual experience is a play of presence and absence: we always experience more than what is simply given to us
- What we see is never in isolation
- There is no view from nowhere: only an embodied point of view. *The perceiver must be located in the same space occupied by the alarm clock.*
- Perceptual exploration
- Time is important in bodily exploration: the back does not go from mind even if from appearance.
- The alarm clock's appearance changes gradually: therefore our stream of consciousness must be temporally and experientially unified

Up to Appearance and Reality
- Phenomenology tells us about how phenomena *apparently* are.
- The phenomenon vs the noumenon
- To know what the object 'really is', the traditional notion is that we must go beyond the merely phenomenal.
- Heidegger: phenomenology invokes a different understanding of the phenomenon: the phenomenon is that which shows itself.
- Phenomenology is not a theory about the merely apparent: the phenomenon is something in itself.
- Two-world doctrine: world as it presents itself, vs. the world as it is in itself
  - Not a metaphysical split but rather, according to the phenomnologists, different modes of manifestation.
- Transcendentalism is rejected by phenomenologists
  - Abuse of the concept of reality
  - A defense of reality?
  - Objectivity is to be located in the appearing world

### Chapter 2: Intentionality
- What can I think about?
- Consciousness has a directedness -- intentionality
- Consciousness is self-transcending -- it points beyond itself
  - Interesting, because I suppose I would think recursive relations are the real transcending
- Connection between experiential subjectivity and worldly objects
- Consciousness is interested with objects and events different from consciousness itself
- We're never just conscious of an object in and of itself (simpliciter), but in a particular way
  - The same object can be intended in different ways. (What does this mean philosophically -- we are holding the object as first?)

Perception and Pictures
- We can be conscious of hypothetical objects -- we are directed towards the same object or type of object, but it shows itself in different ways.
- Intentional acts: linguistic (indirect), pictorial (indirect), perceptual (direct)
  - What does this mean? What if I am not referring to a particular object when I make use of indirect intention? What is the object here?
- Perceptional intentionality is more 'basic' than more complex form of intentionality. (This is potentially problematic in its logocentrism.)
- When I see a painting-portrait, I can observe the image-thing, the image-thing, and the image-subject. 
  - One object depicts another object!
  - Perceptory/appearance similarity does not imply otological similarity
  - In order to see what is depicted in a picture, we both have to see and not see what is in front of us
  - Peripheral awareness of the image-thing
  - Question: What is the ontological status of say, figures which I have only seen on television? How real are they if I have never experienced them directly? And why do I have faith that if I see Biden on MSNBC that it is the same Biden that I see on CNN or Fox?

Representation and Causality
- Intentionality of consicousness is a difficult situation
- Consciousness is outwards-directed
- How can the mind direct towards otherness?
- One idea: experiences are themselves subjective happenings. One needs to introduce an interface between the mind and the world to explain intentionality then. The cake affects my sensory apparatus and causes the mental representation to emerge for me.
- Rejected! Two criticisms
  - Representational mediation. Courts skepticism: why should awareness of an inner object enable awareness of an external object? We perceive an object first before its representational property.
  - Causal explanation. The physical dimension is not enough: when I look through binoculars, why don't I perceive the lenses of the binoculars? etc.: causality is too coarse to understand intentionality. It doesn't give us enough. Moreover, existing spatial objects constitute a small part of what I can be conscious of; what about absent objects, impossible objects, fictive objects?
- Perceptual experience is not an internal movie screen: perceptual experience gives us the object immediately; we do not need internal representation for experience.
  - Rather than representation, perception is presentation.
- The mind is not simply an object
- Clarifying the relation between the mind and the world

### Chapter 3: Methodological Considerations
- What is the phenomenological method?

Epoche and Reduction
- Certain methodological steps are required for understanding phenomenology
- We cannot be content with mere words, we must go back to things themselves.
  - Is this turning away from theories and interpretations?
- Bracketing or suspension (performance as epoche)
- Two interpretations of the epoche:
  - We have to bracket our existing ways of thinking. Let us turn back towards objects, and let the objects reveal themselves as what they are. (de-fetishize?)
  - We need to resituate ourselves from natural preoccupations with worldl objects. It reveals dimensions of our subjective lives.
- Both are mistaken: phenomenology is not a turn to the object or a return to the subject, but instead to investigate the interrelaltion between objects and subjects. 
- Another incorrect interpretation of phenomenology: phenomenology is a metaphilosophical or methodological approach rather than a metaphysical doctrine. The purpose is to limit the scope of investigation to experience; other issues are excluded.
- Heidegger: scientific ontology is nothing but phenomenology
- epoche is not the exclusion fo reality but a dogmatic attitude about reality which permeates scientific positivism.
  - Philosophy cannot assume natural realism; to prejudice the answer.
- We must suspend our belief in the mind-independent existence of the world.
- Epoche -- turning-away from natural human interests -- exclusion of a naive prejudice on the metaphysical status of the world.
  - Rediscover the relation between the mind and the world
- Following the epoche is the transcendental reduction: pay attention to what worldly objects are given -- we come to understand the relation between object and perceiver. The transcendental reduction is the systematic analysis of the correlation between subjectivity and the world
- Liberation from naturalistic dogmatism

Transcendental Philosophy
- Husserl affirms that he belongs to transcendental philosophy: not the disclosing of new factsbut rather in investigating the preconditions for reality. Why is objectivity possible in the first place?
- We continue to investigate the worldly object, but now not naively. Consciousness is not just object in but subject *for* the world
- Epoche / reduction are the preconditions for philosophically investigating reality.
- Heidegger: everyday existence is characterized by forgetting and objectification of the self
- Phenomenological analysis gives a certain violence.
- Tension between Husserlian and post-Husserlian phenomenologists

Up to Transcendental philosophy
