## Week 1 Tuesday
- Heidegger and Husserl -- an Oedipal story
- Heidegerrian apologism
- Midsommar, Hereditary
- Lonergan -- Jesuit priest, very well educated, a polymath. 
  - Militant Longerganians
  - Jesuit departure from Catholicism: intellectual response to the reformation, a counter-reformation
  - Theory of history which is more informative than Marx and Hegel
  - CHID prgoram developed as in the history of Lonergan
  - Lonergan does phenomenology too -- puts Husserl in the shade?
- Hegel: position, negation, negation of negation
- Nature, sin, grace; progress, decline, redemption
- What is the problem if evil exists on its own? Well God will have created it; evil is therefore the absence of good, since God made good: evil is our failure to desire the good -- evil is something which doesn't happen but which should
- For Lonergan you need a transcendental dimension; for Hegel the synthesis emerges from the dialectic. 
- Hegel doesn't really have a principle of bad: what appears to be bad is setting up for something good
- Same with Marx
- Theodicy -- to justify God -- logical exercises in the goodness of God
- Intentionality -- directedness to an "object"; the ontological status is in question
  - Object: noema, cogitata
  - Our consciousness is always directed towards objects, it is always a consciousness "of"
  - No such thing just as "I'm conscious" -- my consciousness is always directed at some object
  - The *term* of an act of consciousness. I always have a term of consciousness. There is the noesis and the noema.
  - Noesis: from latin, gnosis (knowledge, mental activity); gnoetic -- mental life and activity.
  - English: thinking and the thought -- cogitationes and cogitata
  - There is always pair: never a noema without a noesis and never a noesis without a noema.
  - For any cogitata without a cogitationes, what does that mean? We are never just considering an object without it being observed.
  - Try to think about an object which you aren't thinking about
- Ontology: levels of being. Some ontological questions include, what are the statuses of mathematical vs. physical objects.
- Phenomenology -- phenomena and logos, logos from logein/lire/lesen -- to read off the phenomena
  - Interpreting of the phenomena, whatever happens to be in your experience. Attending to it as it is given to you, irrespective of what it might be independently of you
  - Phenomena / noumena (thing in itself). We don't worry about the noumenal. 
  - Bracketing: don't worry about the noumenal. The epoché. Since in some sense by definition the noumena does not appear
  - Tricks -- there is a way in which the noumena is another phenomena. Constitution -- we constitute the object through our noetic acts.
  - Husserlian term: I see a profile. Every object you see, you never see the backside of it, but you say you see the object. So how does an object exist for you? How does it be an object for you? You constitute it? 
  - I constitute an object because a constitute another subject who views the object. 
  - Compossibility -- compossible intentions, the totality of possibilities have you intended, they are cointended. Overcoming the idea that the nouema is just given to me. The noema is the full object but it is never given to me unless/until I constitute it
  - Intentionality vs cointentionality.
  - There is one cogitata which appears, but there are other cogitata (the backside) which I cointend -- to what extend does it appear to me? As a possibility. 
  - Many problems in philosophy occur from us not really grasping what we have grasped.
- Do children see 3 dimensions? They have some sense of depth perception.
- Principle of conservation, object permanence: you've constituted them as the same. 
- Genetic phenomenology -- generating objects over time. vs. static phenomenology -- already constituted for all of us, but we can trace a geneology of phenomenology.
- Husserl says that Heidegger slips back into the issue by marking epoché as ontological. 
- What about two dimensional depictions? I can be intending the Mona Lisa, but it's an empty intention: the noema is not filling the noesis, not fulfilling the intention. Some objects you can never fulfill the intention. But you can fill it in by anticipating how others will see it. 
- Infinite regress of constitution?
- Epoché, from ancient skepticism: for any claim, you can forulate its opposite, and they are equally powerful (equipolence). We do not know in the face of equipolence, we just cannot judge; right now it appears to me to be sweet. I am not going to make ontological assertions now, though.
  - The act of bracketing the question; what are you? To me *now*, you look to me to be ...
- What is being? What really is? Not what we thought it was.
- What we thought was the noema really is something else.
