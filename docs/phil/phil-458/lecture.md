## Week 1 Tuesday -- Introduction to Phenomenology
- Heidegger and Husserl -- an Oedipal story
- Heidegerrian apologism
- Midsommar, Hereditary
- Lonergan -- Jesuit priest, very well educated, a polymath. 
  - Militant Longerganians
  - Jesuit departure from Catholicism: intellectual response to the reformation, a counter-reformation
  - Theory of history which is more informative than Marx and Hegel
  - CHID prgoram developed as in the history of Lonergan
  - Lonergan does phenomenology too -- puts Husserl in the shade?
- Hegel: position, negation, negation of negation
- Nature, sin, grace; progress, decline, redemption
- What is the problem if evil exists on its own? Well God will have created it; evil is therefore the absence of good, since God made good: evil is our failure to desire the good -- evil is something which doesn't happen but which should
- For Lonergan you need a transcendental dimension; for Hegel the synthesis emerges from the dialectic. 
- Hegel doesn't really have a principle of bad: what appears to be bad is setting up for something good
- Same with Marx
- Theodicy -- to justify God -- logical exercises in the goodness of God
- Intentionality -- directedness to an "object"; the ontological status is in question
  - Object: noema, cogitata
  - Our consciousness is always directed towards objects, it is always a consciousness "of"
  - No such thing just as "I'm conscious" -- my consciousness is always directed at some object
  - The *term* of an act of consciousness. I always have a term of consciousness. There is the noesis and the noema.
  - Noesis: from latin, gnosis (knowledge, mental activity); gnoetic -- mental life and activity.
  - English: thinking and the thought -- cogitationes and cogitata
  - There is always pair: never a noema without a noesis and never a noesis without a noema.
  - For any cogitata without a cogitationes, what does that mean? We are never just considering an object without it being observed.
  - Try to think about an object which you aren't thinking about
- Ontology: levels of being. Some ontological questions include, what are the statuses of mathematical vs. physical objects.
- Phenomenology -- phenomena and logos, logos from logein/lire/lesen -- to read off the phenomena
  - Interpreting of the phenomena, whatever happens to be in your experience. Attending to it as it is given to you, irrespective of what it might be independently of you
  - Phenomena / noumena (thing in itself). We don't worry about the noumenal. 
  - Bracketing: don't worry about the noumenal. The epoché. Since in some sense by definition the noumena does not appear
  - Tricks -- there is a way in which the noumena is another phenomena. Constitution -- we constitute the object through our noetic acts.
  - Husserlian term: I see a profile. Every object you see, you never see the backside of it, but you say you see the object. So how does an object exist for you? How does it be an object for you? You constitute it? 
  - I constitute an object because a constitute another subject who views the object. 
  - Compossibility -- compossible intentions, the totality of possibilities have you intended, they are cointended. Overcoming the idea that the nouema is just given to me. The noema is the full object but it is never given to me unless/until I constitute it
  - Intentionality vs cointentionality.
  - There is one cogitata which appears, but there are other cogitata (the backside) which I cointend -- to what extend does it appear to me? As a possibility. 
  - Many problems in philosophy occur from us not really grasping what we have grasped.
- Do children see 3 dimensions? They have some sense of depth perception.
- Principle of conservation, object permanence: you've constituted them as the same. 
- Genetic phenomenology -- generating objects over time. vs. static phenomenology -- already constituted for all of us, but we can trace a geneology of phenomenology.
- Husserl says that Heidegger slips back into the issue by marking epoché as ontological. 
- What about two dimensional depictions? I can be intending the Mona Lisa, but it's an empty intention: the noema is not filling the noesis, not fulfilling the intention. Some objects you can never fulfill the intention. But you can fill it in by anticipating how others will see it. 
- Infinite regress of constitution?
- Epoché, from ancient skepticism: for any claim, you can forulate its opposite, and they are equally powerful (equipolence). We do not know in the face of equipolence, we just cannot judge; right now it appears to me to be sweet. I am not going to make ontological assertions now, though.
  - The act of bracketing the question; what are you? To me *now*, you look to me to be ...
- What is being? What really is? Not what we thought it was.
- What we thought was the noema really is something else.

## Week 1 Thursday -- The Aristotelian and Scholastic Backdrop to Phenomenology
- Husserl - not deeply invested in the history of philosophy, came relatively late
- Often raised philosophical questions about mathematics
- *Eichman in Jeruselem*, Arendt. The banality of evil. Augustin -- evil is a deprivation. Arendt: what is distinct about the 20th century was its banality: its passionlessness, bureaucrats signing papers.
  - Macnumera: fro putting out cars to napalm
  - Evil is no longer an affair of passion but one of abstract technocratic faceless banality
- Eichman on trial: asked "why?" Response: "Just being a good Kantian".
- Talk vs obey. Just obeying orders
- Husserl was responding to Franz Brentano, who did know his HoP. 
- Medeival period -- *Suma Theologia*, Aquinas (summation of theology). Aristotle is 'the philosopher'. 
- Aristotle, then Aquinas, Brentano, then Husserl
- Decartes' meditations on first philosophy. In modernity, first philosophy (foundational philosophy) transformed from metaphysics to epistemology. 
  - For Aristotle: metaphysics is the first philosophy
  - Modernity: epistemology is the first philosophy
- Aristotle: De anima, peri psyche -- on the soul. Deals with what we think are epistemological issues, but articulated here in terms which are established in a larger metaphysical context. 
- When epistemology becomes first philosophy, there is an attempt not to presuppose a first metaphysics until we get clear on the epistemology.
  - Previously: build other things like ethics, politics, study of the soul, logic from metaphysical presuppositions
- Post-Christian baggage of 'soul' not carried with the psyche -- perhaps 'mind'. 
- Quick and dirty of Aristotle: not context for seeing where phenomenology comes from. We can see the natrue of the problem we are responding too.
- Basic Aristotelian metaphysics
  - Potency, form, act
  - Potency -- adult human
  - Form -- shipbuilder
  - Act -- ship building
  - Every adult human is potentially a shipbuilder
  - Potentiality becomes formed, and it is a metaphysical transformation. 
  - Activity of building a ship -- an activity. 
  - Eye, Sight, Seeing
  - What is the relation between form and act? 
  - Metaphysics as the basic constituents of reality
  - Aristotle: a new reality emerges because I am fundamentally in my being different from potency to form
  - Virtue is a form -- only the person who has the form of virtue can act virtuously. 
    - Act must originate from a virtuous form to be virtuous in and of itself: metaphysically virtuous.
  - Shipbuilding is a practical virtue -- virtue as *skill* (e.g. virtuoso)
  - technicality:
    - Potency: first potency
    - Form: first act, second potency
    - Act: second act
  - Acts can become potencies for further acts
  - Another example: human mind, science, understanding/sciencing (a theorem)
    - Human mind as a plate of potentiality
    - Sciencia: knowledge. Science is the actualization of knowledge.
  - Also: potency, form, act -- first nature, second nature, act
  - Phenomenology: the only thing which actually happens is act, because that is what is happening.
  - Form is that by which you act: a first act, but really a potency.
  - An act is a different metaphsycial reality than potency and form. 
  - Aristotle knows about consciousness but it is couched in metaphysical terms which are also applied to things which are not conscious the way we are, such as the growth of a plant or abstract motion. 
  - Three kinds of souls for Aristotle: vegetative, sensitive, and intellectual. 
  - Aristotle -- applies a method of analysis to all souls equally. 
    - Vegetative: life forms
    - Sensitive: conscious forms
    - Intellectual: humans, angels, maybe God
  - Phenomenology: we cannot just have a generic method equally useful for plant life and for human life.
    - Universality and particularity: favoring particularity by phenomenology
  - Aristotle as a 'less sophisticated' even if less brilliant method
  - Undifferentiated -- different realities understood with one method. 
  - A metaphysical analysis of the soul, which is different from what phenomenology does.
  - Maslow gets 'self-actualization' from the Aristotelian "first act, second potency" of form
    - Act: doing the thing which you self-actualize to do
  - Claim: potency is metaphysically improverished, form too. Act is on its own; but potency is on its way to act.
  - Potentiality and actuality will collapse: everything is an actuality. -- Sartre.
  - Potentiality not be: it is potentially something. 
  - Abortion: what is the metaphysical status of the potency of a human fetus (not in act yet)
    - What if potency is real, just not the same reality as act?
  - A plurality of acts become potency for another form. 
  - Actions augment the original potency
  - The soul: for Aristotle, psyche (de anima, from the Scholastics in latin): potens omnia facere et fieri -- the human mind can become anything
    - For Plato, all knowledge is recollected -- we have it in us, we just recollect it; Aristotle says we have all knowledge in us potentially
    - Materia prima, prime matter -- the potency of potencies, just not anything yet, the fundamental potency, it is not anything but it could be something, as opposed to nothingness: potency is not yet anything, but it is not yet nothing. It is potentially something. Sartre says: nah, it's nothing -- potency is nothing.
    - We all can potentially become things: sounds like a God. God is pure act
    - To think through something is to have that reality exist in your cognitive processes. There is no limit, we can become anything, on the spiritual or mental level.
  - Poesis: making something, poetry as the fundamental making.
  - To know something is to become something -- not on the level of matter, but on the level of intentionality. 
  - Lonergan: potency is the principle of limitation, which is why God is pure act
  - But we are potentially infinite. 
  - Metaphysical evil is the failure to be: we are called to come to be, and for some irreason we don't (anxiety, dread -- what do we dread most of all, being? procrastination -- you are about to be something more and you irrationally evade it)
  - Form is what directs act: I know the form of a triangle before I draw it. (But where does the form exist? Not even in y mind, fully)
- Lonergan -- historicized metaphysical categories. 
- Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, Brahe -- acts. Newton -- synthesize into form. Newtonians doing things --- synthesize as Einstein.
  - Evolution: species is latin for form. Individuals doing things (potency) $$\to$$ species (form) $$\to$$ act
- Epistemological turn in modernism with Hegel -- the historical consciousness turn: history is not just static (universal), but there are wide differences in ways of being and this has fundamental epistemological significance. 
  - Archaic Greek did not have a word for acts like seeing or thinking -- did they know that they were seeing or thinkig? Homer: instead of Achilles thought, he says: Achilles deliberated with his horse. Not seeing, but rather Achilles' profile was present to him. 
  - Historicization `<3`
- Two fundamentally different kinds of act: actus imperfecti and actus perfecti.
  - Imperfect act and perfect act
  - Greek: kinesis and energeia
    - Movement and energy
    - Now we think of energy as potency -- but energeia was originally an act. 
  - Movement is metaphysically imperfect act, ontologically incomplete: what it is now is not what it will be, there is a finitude of temporality.
  - Aristotle: the movement through an act towards a term, telos, goal, objective -- the act and the term of the act are distinct. Once the act reaches its term, the act is over. But the movement at any moment is not at any instance what it will be. 
    - Perfective and imperfective verbs in linguistics!!! Completion vs doing
  - Motion is the act of the potential insofar as it remains in potency
  - Motion is the essential becoming; all motion is becoming and all becoming is motion.
  - Categories of change: growth, local, ...
  - Kinesis: all becoming; it is an imperfect reality. An act of the potential still in potency; definitionally on the way.
  - Aristotelian definition of time: the measure of motion. A day is the measure of motion (the Sun). 
  - Mtion as motion is not intrinsically intelligible: just being in motion is not reality, but itself it is not understandable: it needs to reference an origin and an end. 
  - Newtonian physics: motion as motion is not understandable, you instead study the acceleration, the difference which makes a difference, the derivative. motion as motion is really act.
  - We experience it as an intrinsically act on its way to what it will become.
  - Motion is an ontologically inferior reality -- when it is completed it is over. It is also intrinsically temporal. 
  - Perfective: the act and the term of the act are coincident. Hobbes -- human life as the restless pursuit of power after power, ceasing only in death. Life is only motion which ends in death. We don't know how to rest. Life is an imperfect act?
  - Shipbuildinng is a motion -- it is an act, but an imperfective act. Studying is likewise an imperfective act. 
  - Perfect acts: seeing, hearing, tasting, understanding, judging. These are ontologically complete. One is never on the way to seeing: you are either seeing or you are not. You are seeing: it is ontologically coplete in the instance it occurs. Motion is on the other hand always lacking what it will be
  - Perfect acts are intrinsically outside of time. But they are not temporal in the way that motion is temporal. 
  - A motion as complete is over.
  - A tree is spatially different from me, but it is not different from my spatial act of seeing: it is the sense of being perfect, complete, not lacking. The tree is not outside my act of seeing it.
    - Can something be nonspatial but temporal?
  - You are potentially pure act
- The entrance of phenomenology: the act and the object are always coincident: the problem of the bridge, is something outside of me? wrong question: how can affirm something I see is different from me? It is one reality?

```
Russian verbs which only exist in the perfective
понять (ponyat') - to understand (perfective only)
узнать (uznat') - to find out (perfective only)
сделать (sdelat') - to make/do (perfective only)
найти (nayti) - to find (perfective only)
остановиться (ostanovit'sya) - to stop (perfective only)
начать (nachat') - to start (perfective only)
увидеть (uvidet') - to see (perfective only)
договориться (dogovorit'sya) - to agree (perfective only)
```

## Week 2 Tuesday -- Husserl's Introduction to Phenomenology
- Get started on reflection papers
- Discussion leader next week
- Actus imperfecti (kinesis) and actus perfecti (energeia)
- Imperfect act -- motion -- motion is inherently spatial and temporal
- Motion is an intrinsically complete act -- on its way to something else. The completion of the act and the act itself are distinct.
- The act of seeing: the tree you see isn't spatially distinct from your act of seeing. As a perfect act, the act and the term of the act are coincident.
  - You're never on your way to seeing -- either you see or you don't see.
  - The act of seeing persists through time
  - There are always light waves, sound waves, etc. as imperfective acts towards me. But when they reach my eyes I see, i.e. it is the perfective act.
- Once you understand the truth of a sentence, you don't stop understanding it -- it is a complete act
- Imperfective and perfective aspects in grammar
- Potency is not inert -- it anticipates form.
  - Potency -- dunamis, tendency, tending towards
  - Previous acts of understanding become potency for more -- part of a larger dynamism
- Humans are potentially dynamically oriented towards becoming on the level of nous (intellect) all things
- Each act is a partial actualization of this dynamic dimension.
- In our seeing, we are making them more be -- they are not fully what they be until they are comprehended; there is no beauty outside of the act of appreciating; there is no act of being beautiful. There is a sense there in that we only exist when we're known by God. 
- Prime potency -- potentially all things on the level of material reality
- We are potentially all things on the level of intellectual reality
- Prime potency doesn't 'exist' -- something in potency doesn't exist -- things only exist insofar as they have been formed
- Final actualization occurs in the act of appreciating the art itself, which doesn't happen metaphysically unless there is the act of appreication. There is a sense in which we only fully act when we're known...
- When you are in the act, you are fully doing what the act has you do
- You have halfway understood but you have not understood halfway; whereas I can shipbuild halfway
- Unlimited potentiality, a horizon -- which Husserl asserts science strives for.
- Questions are metaphysically bizarre. Meno's parodox: learning is impossible. Either you know something, in which case you can't learn it. Or you don't know something, in which case you can't look for it and don't know where to find it, so you can't learn it.
  - Socrates: we 'unforget' -- we knew everything to begin with. But it's a myth of recollection -- as if we recall things
  - Aha! moment -- that's it, that's sort of like when you forget your keys and you remember where they are.
  - Potency as desire to know is the bizarrest of desires -- asking questions -- you both know and do not know what you are looking for.
  - It's the act of potency insofar as it remains in potency: questions are the act of knowing insofar as it is still in potency
  - Metaphysically, here we have an act which is not fully in act -- a desire to know which is a dynamic orientation
  - When the potentiality is actualized the activity which results is a perfect act; the dynamism of knowing resolves into the perfect act of understanding, as opposed to the dynamism of mere motion (the act ceases).
  - Potency is always anticipatory
- Sense in act is sensed in act -- there may be sound waves but there is no sounding -- it is one act; sounding and hearing are metaphysically the same reality.

| | Subject | Object |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Potency | Human | Tree |
| Form | Faller / striker | Falling / struck |
| Act | Sounding / sound | Sounding / sound |

- "You are the music while the music lasts" -- dancing is not just motion, something more: it is a motion which is formed, and in the full sense it also has to be appreciated. Dance is a unity of motion and act, metaphysically beyond mere motion. There are different ways to be present. You forget about yourself -- in some sense you are the music, and in some sense you are the dance -- there is a sense in which you can render your life as a perfect act in the sense that you are not in agony about the future.
- Intellect in act is intelligible in act -- metaphysically, the act of understanding (intellecting) is not distinct from what is intelligible.
- In order to be, you have to be known. If you're intelligible, to be fully in act, you have to be understood by something
- Hell as God doesn't know you -- you're forgotten
- The dance as motion occurs over time, but as danceit exists throught ime
- Play -- activity for its own sake
- You don't become a tree when you see a tree, but in a sense you do. You take on the form without the matter.
  - Seeing: sensible form without matter
  - Understanding: intelligible form without matter
- Seeing is a fundamental part of your being -- the thing is you, it's making up part of what I am -- it's the form of the thing without the matter.
- The act of seeing isn't really spatial -- the tree is here in the same sense that you see there. We are distinct insofar as we have different matter. 
- Aristotle says form without matter, but we never just experience matter -- so how do we know if there really is anything there?
- This question just didn't get raised -- the critical turn with Decartes through Kant -- how do we know what we experience isn't an illusion?
- We only experience an act -- never potency / matter. If matter is the way by which I am different from others, then I am just me
- Omnipotent -- omni, potency
- On the level of the intelligible, in knowing something, we become that thing. Prime matter can become all things on the material level -- and nous / ego / cogita on the conceptual level.
- We never experience things insofar as they are determinations of our consciousness.
  - Never "out there", always "in here"
- In here / out there -- are distinctions you draw in here -- determinations you've made
- Treat consciousness as a field -- but it's you -- you're not just a body
- Insofar as we can become all things, our ultimate horizon is being. 
- Apodicticity -- known with absolute certainty
- Decartes -- it's impossible to doubt that you're doubting -- it's undubidable insofar as I am doubitng that I be
- It is apodictically certain that I am thinking -- if I try to doubt I am thinking, I am doing thinking
- Decartes was on the way but he gets sidetracked because he carries with him a lot of baggage from the Scholastic tradition which Husserl wants to axe
  - Decartes says "I am a thinking thing" 
  - Substance is the thing which stands underneath or behind the phenomena
  - We are all substances for Aristotle
  - No one experiences substantance as substance -- substance is still a kind of potency underlying it; never an actuality in experience
  - This is where Husserl says Decartes went too far -- a metaphysical reality which is not a phenomena of himself as a thinking substance. I've seen phenomena but nver substance as substance; I have to infer that.
  - Decartes -- if there is thinking, every thing has a substance behind it, so I must be a thikning thing
- We have to start only from the apodictic reality that the activity of thinking is happening. This is what is given in an experience. 
- Intentional existence -- presence of form without matter -- it exists intentionally within us.
- Idea of a substance is not something which is really an object of experience as experienced.
- Bracketing -- stop presupposing an underlying substance.

## Week 2 Thursday -- Husserl's Introduction to Phenomenology II (Meditation 1)
- You can trace throughout archaic Greek the emergence of the mind -- in pre-Homeric Greek you don't have the language for 'mental acts' (seeing, tasting, ... understanding, judging, deciding, deliberating)
- Schnel, *Discovery of the Mind* - in Archaic Greek there are no words for mental acts; but presumably people did see, judge, decide, ... -- why weren't there words for them? 
- You can't draw mental acts because they're not spatial realities
- All the action appears to be in the object, whatever is going on -- whatever is being scene, whatever is being understood, being judged, etc. This is prior to the discovery of the mind
- Eventually in Greek these acts begin to show up, and eventually you get philosophers trying to understand these acts
- Plato and Aristotle begin to adopt philosophies by which they begin to reflect on the mind, but they don't even really get at a phenomenology of these acts itself. They don't develop a phenomenology of the acts themselves -- eventually there are words for acts, then philosophyw hich tries to deal with it.
- In the way in which Greek philosophers studied mental acts, Plato and Aristotle applies acts universally -- mental acts as on the same plane as vegitable acts -- same method to different kinds of souls
- Aristotle sees a difference between actus imperfecti anda ctus perfecti -- but he still uses the same set of metaphysical terms. But fundamentally you need a diffferent method with which to investigate mental acts to fully understand what they are (beyong just im/perfect) and in relationship to one another
- A metaphysical rather than a phenomenological account of mental operations provided by the Greeks
- Imperfect acts -- Aristotle kind of sees it, but he was struggling to articulate the reality of metnal acts. But still couched in this kind of metaphysical language. Sees the different realities of seeing vs. motion, but not quite seeing the unique dimension of mental acts
- Scholastics -- started to talk about the act by which one is able to have an object in conciousness as an intentional act. What I see is the sensible form of the thing without the matter, I become the thing I see on the level of intentionality -- I have conceptual intentionality rather than material intentionality in me
- Phenomenology -- I only ever see the tree in me -- I don't see it when I'm not seeing it
- Sartre -- "I'm trying to see what the flowers look like when no one looks at them"
- On the basis of what do I affirm that the tree is not me?
- By limiting ourself to the fact that the thing I see is the sensible form without the matter; the mind is potentially makingna dbecoming all things -- matter and potency are essentially the same things. 
- How do we know that what we see isn't you? How do we establish the externality of objects?
- Givenness -- what is given in an experience? Husserl -- one of the things that isn't given is that that thing is independently of you.
- Metaphysical thing: object and mind, then mind receives the form separate from the form -- as if you already knew that there was a separation -- but you only ever have the form in you. So this fundamentally inverts the problem.
- Subject and object are intrinsically correlated. Zahavi -- phenomenology is the discovery of the correlation between the two (no object without subject, etc.) whereas modern epistemology threatens to trap us in the pure cogito, the pure I think, in subjecthood itself; phenomenology shows us we are always already connected to obejcts.
  - A critical and naive way of reading this interpretation
  - Phenomenological naivete -- you continue to posit or presuppose the being of the world as self-evident. And conscious does it behind its own back -- it's you which posited / presupposed it.
  - This idea that we are connected to the being of the world is a phenomenological naivete -- in order to analyze acts between subject and object, you have to already presuppose the ontological beingness of the object.
  - So with epoche, now we need to bracket and stop presupposing the reality of being as something which is just there and set out before us.
- Old epistemological problem which shows up past the scholastics into Hume and Kant -- present us witht he problem of the bridge. How can I be sure that what gets from the subject gets to the object and vice versa? This is the original Cartesian meditations -- oh gosh, what if this is all the Matrix or an evil demon? 
- Decartes says I am a thinking substance -- but we don't experience ourselves as substance, but as act -- then Decartes goes off the rails -- 'proves' undubidably God. Modern epistemological challenge of the bridge. Hume -- we only have our subjective impressions, we don't know what cuases them, don't worry about it
- Phenomenology -- it was you who already decided that there was a world outside you -- this distinction is within you -- not the problem of bridge but affirming the distinction to begin with. What are the grounds (evidence) for this sort of judgement?
- For phenomenology, subject vs object is already part of the naive attitude -- as if to know something is to know something which is out there. 
- Anxiety is a naive presupposition -- 'how do I get outside of my head' -- but why are you assuming there is an outside to begin with? Why do you assume the basic epistemological problem is the problem of the bridge? -- ensuring what is in here is reliably a representation of, effect of, etc. 
- How can I be sure what I see is the effect of an object? -- Decartes' question, which already presupposes the question of the bridge.
- Aristotle runs into this -- the world of perfect acts which really are nothing at all like motion -- sense in act is sensed in act, metaphysically. Since we only ever experience the sensed in act, how do I know if the sensed is the act? (Flowers, what do they look like when no one is watching them?)
- Objectivity -- how can I be certain that my knowledge is objective?
  - Naive conception -- how can I be sure my subject reception is derived from the object, that there is a relation to the object
  - For Husserl objectivity is constituted by the subject -- we discover things which are apodictic and universal -- it doesn't get you to an 'outside' but beyond you as an individual subject. Your knowledge is not merely your product, because it's not relative to you -- it's absolutely true; universally and necessarily true. 
  - "I think therefore I am" -- an apodictic conclusion
  - Husserl -- you can then build up entire columsn of knowledge -- push you beyond what you are as a limited finite subject, which is where you can go beyond Hume. For Hume it is a deeply subjective reality whereas Husserl thinks we can obtain a degree of objectivity, but not the naive conception of objectivity.
  - There is a Platonic dimension to this
  - This movement of building up is the transcnedental subjectiivty, or the transcendental-phenomenological reduction
- A more immediate context -- hot problems Husserl responds with in the strict philosophical sense -- Husserl is responding to
  - Philosophical disagreement -- lack of unity in knowledge/science because lack of apodictic formulation
    - Persists throughout the whole history of philosophy
    - In some sense it is **the** problem
    - This is what inspires Decartes to write the meditations. How to resolve these differences? 30 years of war in Europe...
    - How do these philosophical ideas conflict? Everyone has different views -- can we generate a universal account of virtue? Aristotle -- try to find this
    - Epoche: Ancient skpetics did this first, because they were the first skeptics to say, let's stop arguing and first reserve judgement -- rather bracket out unproductive elements and work on clearing a new universal ground.
    - Medievals have to include the Bible and its conflicts, plus the church fathers, etc. --- Decartes, start over
    - Hume: start over
    - Kant: start over
    - Husserl: start over
    - Both philosophical but also generally -- why do people disagree? Why can't we get unified? For Husserl we need to have a unity
    - WWI as a philosophical conflict
    - What we need is an apodictically certain foundation to all knowledge, otherwise we will continue to fall with reasonable doubts -- unproductive.
    - An arguably apocalyptic horizon
    - Division from God
  - Supposed devaluation of 'lived experience' by modern science
    - e.g. a reduction of secondary qualities to primary qualtiies
    - Alienation from ourselves / the world / others produced by this scientism
    - Very preoccupied with Galileo; modern science provide this distinction between secondary and primary qualities which are then taken up by all the modern philosophers (Hume et al.): primary quality is mathematically measurable aspects of that object (matter in motion -- weight, mass, density, velocity, etc.) as opposed to secondary qualities (color, sound, etc.) -- movement towards a denial of the reality of secondary qualities or have anything to do with the object -- are 'merely subjective'
    - Epiphenomenal -- layered upon the real thing (the mathematically measurable aspects of matter in motion)
    - Husserl saying -- it's backwards, we only know the primary by way of the secondary; we can't be nearly as certain of the primary qualities as the things which we experience more directly
    - You're not looking behind the secondary qualities for the object
    - What you experience is apodictically certain knowledge
    - You only infer a primary quality based on the idea that you see it move or you see the measurements -- you never see velocity an sich, you see the representations, etc. -- it's less apodictic. 
    - 'Lived experience' (erlehnisse)
    - Reductionism -- Freud; believe in God, *but* you replaced the father you murdered. Freud is a materialist in some sense though.
    - You become alienated from your experience -- can I believe in my experience when Freud tells me about my consciousness? I've never experienced my consciousness an sich... that of what I am conscious of is much more apodictically certain than the matter and motion which would come to me. 
    - Phenomenology as a descriptive science. 
- Ancient skeptics' use of the epoche; Husserl adds more; also the first to point out how philosophers disagreeing are not addressing what should be the goal of settling things.
- Husserl -- there has to be pre-predicative experience
- Attend to what is actually given and what our interpretation is
  - Is this even possible?
- Epoche -- to withhold or suspend judgement / assent -- not denial or affirmation, and it's hard to do. Epoche as a deeply meditative practice (hence Carteisan meditations) -- don't just affirm things and get caught up in disagreements. 
- Husserl -- we can't fully follow Decartes; Decartes proposed a scientific method which we must withhold judgement about, cannot assume it is the scientific method -- we are founding science (sciencia, knowledge) itself -- we can't even presuppose you know what science is yet. 
  - Science as geometry -- from axioms to theorems. 
  - Even geometry is dubidable
- I am looking for an axiom from which I can start out from. '
- Husserl: you didn't successfully doubt it -- you carried it along with you
- Opposite of apodicticity -- presupposed (that which is doubtful but assumed, which is not grouunded)
- Decartes did not ground his presupposition that geometry was the right type of way to do philosophy -- it's not apodictic, we need to keep on going, to find a truly apodictic foundation to all knowledge.
- Core -- searching for an apodictic foundation to all knowledge. Husserl says, is the being of the world apodictically certain? Is it indubidable that there is a world existing distinct from me? Is it absolutely certain? Indubidable? It could be an illusion. 
- Does Husserl presuppose a notion of science with his notion of apodicticity? Objectivity as an ascent to the universal.
- Husserl -- phenomenology is the true positivism (which claims to stick with only what is experienced -- they've missed a lot of what is experienced ine xpeirence, not least being the acts themselves).
- Being in the world is dubidable. By reason of evidence of natural experience, must no longer for us be an obvious fact. It must henceforth only  be a phenomenon -- we bracket its existence. We treat it as what appears -- we don't judge is it real or not. We need to find what is indubidable.
- The Being of the world is not gien to us -- it is not apodictic. 
- Epoche: entails a reduction -- removing presuppositions but also enriching, a discovery of a new 'continent'
- The existence value  of the world is something we give to it.
- Zahavi -- this entails a religious conversion -- you have to go through this experience of 'I'm floating, and I don't know what is real -- I just have my experiences... am I now trapped?' But this is already presupposing that I need to get out. Some people say no, Husserl is actually saying we don't have to worry about the epistemological problem b/c we're always connected to the world, consciousness of ... but Husserl is saying, yes,, we are conscious of *a* world -- this is apodictically true. But is it *the* world? Not so sure.
- The natural attitude -- the naive perspectivce -- is forbidden when we do phenomenology, we bracket these things.
- Zahavi tries to say that Husserl takes this back -- the true ontic reality is now set truth, we don't lose anything -- this is false, we keep our world but we bracketed the existence/meaning value of it. 
- Subject and object correlate is not religious conversion -- epoche is saying first in order to understand what acts are doing we can't presuppose that world because for all we know we could have constituted it -- if you want to keep the world, you will have to give it up.

## Week 3 Tuesday: Universality in Phenomenology I (Meditation 1, 2)
- Husserl -- we're not looking for transcendence (this is what is bracketed in the epoche) -- the world as transcending consciousness; we only ever know and experience that which is in consciousness
- Transcendence as opposed to immanence -- we have to limit our investigation to that which is immanent in consciousness
  - Immanence -- within, restricted to
  - That which is within consciousness
  - What is immanent in consciousness -- what is within consciousness
  - Conscious acts are not spatial; consciousness is not spatial; within implies there is an in and an out, that it is a spatial location
  - To what extent is a tree in my consciousness? vs. a water is in my bottle
  - Space is in consciousness. We are gonna restrict ourselves to something in consciousness in a different sense from what is in containers. But we can get tripped up on this. We have to overcome biases which arise from the natural attitude -- biases about what reality is, waht knowing is, what it means to attain transcendence from a naive natural attitude.
- 'within' consciousness: already potentially an embodiment of the natural attitude
- object -- something which stands over and against consciousness as opposed to something which is immanent in consciousness. object -- 'over against', from latin (project, objectus). But we have to overthrow this bias, that this is just what an object is. So we're going to use knew words -- stuff, content, the meant. But we have to struggle against object. Even Husserl has to overcome biases which emerge in the natural attitude and which are sedimented in language. 
- Transcendence -- that which will transcend consciousness, distinct from consciousness, etc. Husserl calls to attention that that which is transcednent to consciousness is in consciousness -- how else could you conceive of it?
- Transcendence -- also a theological context, leaving or going beyond this world.
- Epistemological or theological senses for the transcendent.
- Transcendental -- conditions of the possibility of experience, knowledge, 
- For Kant and the modern turn to the subject: the subjective conditions for the possibiility of experience -- what needs to be true for consciousness such that experience is possible at all? The transcendental refers to the deeply internal now -- 
- If we are talking about the transcendental, we are not exactly talking about transcendence -- it is almost even reversed in a particular sense (but with both we have an outside-immanence)
  - For Kant the transcendental is unconscious
- **Question** -- what counts as conscious? If I am indirectly aware of something (e.g. I receive representations or measurements from something), am I really conscious of it?
- Intentionality does not mean on purpose or volitional -- that I consciously or purposely create/intend something. From Brentano through Husserl, rather directedness to an object, term, content, 'meant'. Volitional acts are intentional. But also just by seeing fish, you are also performing an intentional act; it is directed at something.
  - Why not 'attending', 'attention'? Perhaps attending is one kind of intending
- Epoche -- the concrete conscious and intellectual practice of suspending or withholding judgement about the existence or ontological status of the world
  - The world is the generic term of consciousness at this point which we all have -- whether that world which we have has anything to do with the world, we are bracketing for now. Stop presupposing a world beyond my word or your world.
  - So do we run into transcendental solipsism? Maybe, but no -- it leads towards transcendental intersubjectivity. But we won't judge whether it is my world
  - Not a mere mental experiment, but a practice -- you have to actively engage in it; it cannot be done for you. 
  - While you are on a jury, you suspedn judgement until you have enough evidence to suggest otherwise 
- The natural attitude is the attitude of consciousness which apodictically presupposes the existence of the world which is wholly distinct from the subject. The world transcends consciousness. In the epoche, we bracket the question of transcendence -- 'objccts' are immanent terms of intentional acts. 'Objectivity' is attaining knowledge which is existent independently of our consciousness.
- We're not given being as being.
- Phenomenology as a religious conversion
- People were doing phenomenology before phenomenology -- Kierkegaard, Nietzsche (psychology), St. Augustin
- For Kierkegaard, the Abraham-Isaac story reveals that we have to be willing to sacrifice immediate attachment to existence in order to relate to it on an ethical and religious level; Husserl demands something similar on the rational level
- St. Augustin: memory is almost infinite, and in some sense all of the world is in my memory; but maybe my memory is in the world? I can live in memory... Phenomenology of memory is wild
- The 'naivete' of the natural attitude -- to be phenomenologically naive is to fail to critically account for consciousness to posit the existence of the world; world is presupposed and already posited, set out; not realizing that existence is posited by us
- Phenomenology comes in after the fact
- Hegel: we constitute the world but we 'forget' it -- we do not recognize our own activity in the world; and we confront it as a gegenshtein; as already out there. Then you do philosophy and you think the problem of philosophy is the problem of the bridge.
- There is an epistemological problem of objectivity, but not about getting from the subject to the object -- the problem of the bridge is a false problem. We've presupposed that the world must already be out there rather than something that consciousness posits for itself. 
- Who inhabits the natural attitude? Everyone. 
- qua -- insofar as
- You can realize when you are asking problems with basic naive presuppositions
- Husserl vs Decartes -- we "haven't really lost things" -- we've changed their identities in a particular sense, by what and how do appearances appear to me?
- Why practice the epoche? Demand for apodicticity in knowledge -- emerges from reason's drive to achieve unity of knowledge
- The idea that if knowledge is knowledge it has to be absolutely certain -- this is potentially a presupposition, maybe emerges from the background of disagreement Husserl emerges from -- for Husserl this is not good
- A layer below utter apodiciticity -- an evidence which excludes doubt but still can be doubted; for Decartes, "I am" is indubidable
- The being of the world is not apodictic (which is why we bracket it): we see red, but we do not see being-red; we hear a high pitch but we do not hear being high-pitched

---

## Week 3 Thursday: Universality in Phenomenology II (Meditation 2)
- Introduction to Hegel's lectures on the history of philosophy -- Hegel is a major thinker bbecause he establishes the concept of intellectual history, history of thought / philosophy / the mind / the spirit -- the mind emerges over time / history
- To understnad philosophy, you have to understand the history of philosophy
- Hegel draws heavily from biological analogies -- more than analogies, even; geist goes all the way down; the World is spirit. It's not just an analogy, but 'this is what the mind is like' on another level
- The ultimate moment of a plant's development is when it bears fruit. At a certain point the fruit is a determination of the plant -- but it can fall off, go to the ground; it can reach a point where the object it produced is now distinct from it. Parallel movement for the mind -- a hypothesis which has been verified -- something is true. Up until you verify it, it's just you -- truthood is the moment of 'transcendence' 
  - When the mind bears fruit and it transcends, "it's not just me" -- in being not just you, it doesn't leave your consciousness.
  - Nature as petrified spirit
  - The fruit is the same 'nature', the same 'nature' as the tree -- even if the tree 'forgets' that (i.e. does not recognize its self in the other)
  - Nature speaks to a hidden knowledge of what spirit really is, but only spirit qua spirit can recognize itself -- distinctions are made in you
  - Something about objectivity and truth, universality wihch has to be something more -- beyond the consciousness
- THe distinction between you and the other is within you
- Understanding things -- you are with them, things are in your consciousness. But it can seem like it's over there, but you're understanding it over here. 
- You desire to be the thing which knows -- is anything I know more than me? But firstly you change; you develop, self-transcend, but generating a hypothesis.
- Epistemic / experiential move -- everything which you say and can conceive of must be registered in your epistemic claims
- Lonergan -- being is divided from within
- Apodicticity instead of truth -- an approximation of what we call 'truth'
- Why practice the epoche? To make philosophy more rigorous and strict -- strenge Wissenshaft by grounding all judgements in evidence
- Evidence -- that which is *actually* given in experience vs the infered, supposed, hypothesized, implied; it is the phenomena, that which actually appears
- First, just describe phenomena as they appear without judging whether or not they 'really exist' or not
- 'Explanatory science' -- physics, chemistry, etc. -- entail things which are inferred and entailed, but which are not given
- Other sciences rely on mere suppositions and beliefs about objects which are not directly given to consciousness
- **Question on evidence** -- things are never given to us necessarily -- are feelings given to us? Can we choose whether or not to experience?
- Lonergan -- the criteria of indubitability is not indubitable -- knowledge is not apodictically apodictic
- Decartes carries out assumptions from Science; and then Husserl does the same thing (what is the criteron of apodicticity if not another presupposition, of an ideal of science which he has not grounded himself)? 
- Performative self contradiction -- the performance of making a claim is in conflict with the content of the claim -- your performance contradicts what you say (but why is this bad necessarily?) -- not particularly a logical claim
  - Maybe not a contradiction, possibly ontological distinction between a claim and the operation of claiming
- Reason itself as the drive for apodicticity -- phenomenology is the only disciplline 'which gets it' -- studies the pheonmena as they appear and doesn't deal with hypothesized entities which don't appear
- Fichte, the infinite striving -- maybe presupposed by Husserl
- Kierkegaard's absolute is paradoxical
- Regulative ideal -- a term/end which you strive for but you can never really reach, the end is absolute as a goal but it's just regulative as opposed to constitutive (you get it) -- you direct your inquiry but you never get there
- Hume - causaity is not apodictic
- Husserl and Freud, contemporaries 
- Objects of explanatory science never real themselves an sich
- Primary and secondary qualities -- a philosophical not a scientific distinction
- I can intend something but what is given to me is actually a particular profile. My attention exceeds what is given. I can fill my exptent attention and over time constitue not just a profile but the thing -- the naive attitude is that is what you see, vs. what you intend
- Transcendental reduction
  - Ego - cogito - cogitatum, a structure which is given in experience
  - My acts are given -- think 'experienced'
  - We don't know what the ontological status is, or rather the ontological status appears to us
- My personal argument: givenness and intention occur simultaneously, in fact what is given is always already intended -- as symbols, as judgements
  - Sight, hearing, etc. -- always already given to us as symbols, as these things -- I can't not see it, the pervasiveness of language. The moment I am conscious of something is the moment I predicate it
- Husserl trying to fulfill a project of founding all philosophical claims in apodictic evidence
- Totalitarianism
- What is the point of the state? Hobbes -- to end philosophical disagreements.
- The utopianism of phenomenology; the violence of modernity
- To view the cogitatum, and then to understand the act of the cogitata which intends it
- Things appear to be hapepning in the universe, but that's really all happening in my head. Acts are conscious -- there is a fundamental phenomenological onlooker -- you exploit thef act that you can in some sense make your own acts objects (the infinite regress) -- you can also onlook upon your ego -- there is the galaxy, and here are my acts; they are both present to me on consciousness: a transcendental onlooker which describes things as they are given
- Ego (self), cogitationes (mental acts), cogitata / cogitatum (intended objects)
- Cogito ego sum -- doesn't really understand that cogito is really an act with a term
- One ego, one field of consicousness -- but you can have multiple acts
- To perceive, to hear, to see: what is restricted?
- Meaning-intention as protention, retention, anticipation
  - Perceiving a symphony -- I can distinguish how in order to perceive the symphony (I can describe perceiving a symphony -- this is given in my experience)
  - At any given time there is an act of hearing with a cogitata and within the ego, conscious of protentions (anticipate the note to come) -- sometimes the protention may not be harmonious witht he content
  - Retention of previous notes -- in order to hear the symphony I must hear the aggregate
  - The continuum of consciousness
- What is given in experience is that you do retend
- "I think, therefore I am" -- what is the "I"? How much of this is already a predicative experience?
- What is the constituttion of meaning
- Nothing is 'lost' in the epoche -- you just don't take it to exist a priori -- this is how I experience it, through these acts
- There is no pre-cogitationes which is distinct from the cogitatum

---

## Week 4 Tuesday: Evidence and Truth (Meditation 3)
- The natural attitude is 'in' the transcendental ego; it is a kind of diminishment or even impoverishment / restriction on the transcendental ego
- You take on this attitude and relate to a 'world' whose existence you presuppose
- If the existence-meaning of the object is not the effect of the transcendental ego, then error is impossible: being is or isn't present to you; how can you ascribe existence-meaning to something if it is a matter of seing if it is there or not? How do you distinguish between illusion and reality? There are possibilities, but whether they be is a determination you make
- Zahavi: Any interest in the being / non-being of the world is forbidden, but Husserl doesn't really mean that -- nothing is lost in the epoche
- The scientist presupposes even the presence of the world 'out there'
- The 'practical interests' -- these are the ends of the natural attitude. 
- We intend things as possible things which we can do things with -- free play of images
- Animals' objects are not quite what our objects are
- We're always perceiving something as if it is something we can do things with
- Disharmonious experience: protention does not agree with intention
- Part of the fanstasy -- 'as if it could do this, as if it could do that'
- Subjective correlates are revealed -- objects are subjective correlates
- Ontic -- ontology (being as being) -- ontic meaning of being is the beingness of whatever being it is; people can be possible (hypothesis) (be as a possibility) vs actual
- The natural attitude comes after the fact
- Delphi the Oracle -- know thyself, a new meaning in transcendental phenomenology -- transcendental science is 'lost in the world'; I must lose the world by epoche to regain it by universal self-reflection
- No -- something is lost, the world as taken by the naive attitude is lost -- the totality of your world, all phenomena, are lost; but as the world of the natural attitude, it is lost; it gets its meaning from you.
- For Decartes, the cogito is a worldless I: Decartes, imagine this is all the matrix / an illusion -- the entirety of the world is dubidable, but myself as an isolated monad of an ego with no world is apodictic; pure consciousness detached from the world.
  - Naive reading: there is no consciousness without object, so there must be a 'real world'
  - But there also is not an object without consciousness
  - The world as more than the phenomenon is lost
- Zahavi -- the problem of the bridge is solved because there is always a bridge
- Intentionality is a correlation: it is not a spatial reality; I don't have to move there to see the tree, the tree is 'here' 'in me'
- "Cogito ergo sum" -- the "ego" is implied. The "ego cogito". What is the "cogito"? There is no thought without thinking; there can be no world without an I and no I without a world: to *think* is to have *a thought*
- Decartes: says, there is just "I think"
- Heidegger -- you can have an 'I'-less world
- Meditation 3: Decarte clarifies / argues that thi s idea of God as personally finite idea -- he can not give an idea, he cannot cause it
- Questions about infinity
- You must lose the world by epoche in order to gain it
- Augustin -- do not wish to go out, go back into youself; it s the inenr man whoo holds truth.
- Basic structure of intntionality for Husserl is this concept of meaning-intention (cogitationes) towards meaning-fulfillment (cogitata, cogitatum)
  - Cogitata somethines do not fulfill the expectations -- no cogituatum, not filled, at least no cogitatum not adequate to the intention itself. The intention is not filled; empty
  - Seeing -- fulfilled in the seen
  - But I percieve a thermos. I could stop percieving a thermos -- I could restrict my intentionality
  - Two aspects of phenomenological reduction & epoche: bracketing, focusing on phenomena as phenomena, and analysis of syntheses
  - Some cogitatum remain unfulfilled and as mere possibilities because there is no cogitata which is adequate to them, which is filled. I can shift my seeing to other things
  - I cannot see a thermos until I conintend 
  - Constituting is synthesizing
- Temporality of the subject and temporality of the object: while cogitationes are correlated to cigtata, the temporality
- Questions
  - To what extend does the object existing for me precede evidence of it? 
  - How can we establish what things 'really are for me' before they 'appear as things for me'? Why? How?
    - It seems like we're trying to pursue a 'phenomenal nouemna' -- if things appear to us as objects, why are we hoping we can get at what they 'really are' for us? In what sense are we replicating the problem of the bridge in the phenomenal?
  - Intentionality and constitution -- don't I have to first constitute the object to be intentional of it?

---

## Week 4 Thursday: Truth & Evidence, Self-Constitution (Meditation 3, 4)
- Being -- you can intend impossibility
- Lonergan: evil doesn't exist; if evil existed, then God would be responsible for it; so evil qua evil doesn't exist
  - The horror of evil is its absence -- a lack of intelligibility
  - Conceiving vs understanding
- The problem of error - metaphysically, how can you ever be wrong of something? Epistemologically, how can you think of something which is not? It must be for you to be able to think about it
  - Parmenides
- Negative judgements -- you cannot refer to that which is not
- The quality of being results from the way that we intend it (possible being)
- When I have a hypothesis, I am intending it as possible
- Marx and Hegel -- "many an innocent flower will be crushed" -- evil isn't really real, it's always in service of the good
- How does consciousness constitute the object according to modes?
- Being and non-being as exclusive disjunctions which although have modes exist for the meant (the object).
  - By contrast, truth and falsity relate to the intentional act, or the *meaning-act* -- (the subject, or the relation between the subject and the object)
  - Truth and falsity are predicates that refer to the relation between the subject and the object. This seems to make sense -- if you're intending the object correctly, you're in the truth. Fulfillment, adequateness, etc.
  - There's a question of the being and non-being of the object, but even further the question of how to relate to it
- Comparison -- to say that you can think of the process of verification/falsification as comparing the object in consciousness with the object 'out there'. To be clear this is a common way to think. In Meno's paradox is an assumption for comaprison -- I see the object in here and does it match what's out there? If I don't have it in here how can I compare to begin with? How do I know what to look for our compare once I've found it?
- You have never been conscious of the thing which is not in your consciousness
- If you already know it, what are you comparing it to? You need to know the 'real thing' and then compare your knowledge to it -- if your knowledge is adequate to it then it must be true. But how do you know this 'real thing'? It's a fundamental problem in the history of philosophy -- breaking the idea that generating truth is comparison with the 'real' (the true...)
- Hegel -- the object emerges from consciousness
- Knowledge has to be self-validating in a certain sense: it can't be validated with comparison -- the knowing itself has to be self-ratifying. It cannot be validated by some kind of comparison. You 'decide' if something is real
- Reason is self-ratifying
- There has to be another way in which knowlwedge qua knowledge emerges in you
- The World for Husserl is all possible givenances -- and this is an *idea* --in this anticipatory relation here; in cointending the backside, I am really cointending the world. What is it that I am cointending? I don't know yet ... it is intended as the unknown
  - "You know it when you see it"
- To break Meno's paradox, you both know and don't know what you are looking for
- Something changes in you from being told "this is what a circle is" vs. it "appearing to you as true" (e.g. you vary -- and you experience, this is what a circle be -- not a comparison)
- Truth -- not two objects, acts which get fulfilled, because acts intend something
- Husserl -- the horizon of infinite possible fulfillments of intention which I already have (Aristotle: yes Plato, all forms are in us already -- but possibly)
  - Mind and being -- go together
- How can you know or get to know without knowing?
- What about the things Ican't anticipate?
- Acts are in some sense abstractions -- first is the unity
- Concretely, anticipating a restriction of a larger anticipation of all being, the result of having cultivated certain habitualities
- You are more than any particular conscious act; the ego is the unity of acts; do you experience the unity of your consciousness as given? When you experience things are you cointending things? 
- Insofar as we restrict ourselves to the red as meant, we think about red and not being-red. But even so predicates hav ea phenomenological origin -- even if they are bracketed in the epoche, we have to account for them phenomenologically -- how do these predicates appear to us in consciousness? Why do we assign being or existing to some meants and not tohers? How to conclude true and false meaning?
- Evidence is a universal primal phenomenon of intentional life, vs. other consciousness-of, which is capable of being non-presentive. Evidence is directly given. ego -- not aiming confusedly at something with expectant intention, but it is at being with itself.
  - Evidence is the givenness of the intended object *as* intended; the fulfillment of the intentional act. 
  - Some intentional acts are not fulfilled -- cointentions, e.g. future notes in a melody or the backside of the object
  - Consciousness is aware that that which it intends is itself there vs merely imagined or anticipated
  - Consciousness is not 'aiming confusedly'
  - All evidence is experience -- the totality of that which is given in experience is evidence. 
  - Evidence vs sense-data
  - passive synthesis and active synthesis. To see dog running, we have to synthesize it -- but this is a passive synthesis. (But synthesizing is acting...) -- it's passive in the sense that you're not acting -- quintessential active synthesis is the act of judgement
  - Judgement -- fundamentally separating -- krisis, to divide. What is being divided? The subject and its predicate -- and then they are synthesized. In order to make a judgement wiht a subject and a predicate, we have to divide the predicate from the subject and then reattach it. "The dog is running" -- there has to be a passive synthesis of perceiving the dog running, but then the active synthesis of saying "the dog is running" -- to separate running from the dog and then reattaching them.
  - Passivity is habitual -- no effort involved, you don't experience effort qua effort when you pass by
  - An active heightening of consciousness when you say, "this is" -- this is the affair complex, which can be given passively or you can make an explicit judgement

---

## Week 5 Tuesday: Truth and Evidence, Self-Constitution; Meditations 3 and 4
- Genesis vs synthesis
- Derrida -- "The Problem of Genesis in Husserl"
- Passive synthesis, active synthesis
- Beyond as transcendent, also transcendence -- the realm beyond this Earthy realm
- "The religious turn in phenomenology" -- a lot of Husserl's early students were Catholic, then maybe athiests took over like Sartre, but then a rebirth of other Catholics and Protestants -- can you do a phenomenology of the religious experience? -- of that which is intrinsically transcendent experience.
- Is Husserl a neo-Kantian? Neo-Kantians -- Hegel takes over 1800 - 1850 after Kant, then the neo-Kantians after 1850, Husserl is born into a movement against Hegel, a deeply neo-Kantian strain to Husserl
- Transcendent: that which is beyond/independent of conscioussness & for the 'world'
- Transcendental: the universal and necessary conditions of the possibility of something, typically experience and/or experience of an object
- First usage of the 'transcendental' (prior to the one solidifed by Kant in the modern era) -- by the Scholastics, have a tradition in which transcendentals are the conditions of the possibility of any object in order to exist
  - Basic transcendentals are truth, being, beauty, goodness, and unity
  - Most necessary and universal categories
  - The transcendentals are convertible for the Scholastics
  - We all exist as unities but God exists as unity *an sich*; so in that sense we only live in God
  - We have a turn to the subject in Kant: they are categories too, but for *experiencing the object* -- not for the condition of the existence of the object itself.
- Substance is the unity underlying the qualities of the object -- what is this the thing which unifies the various properties? Substance -- to first experience the thing at all, we must first apply the category of substance in order to experience the object itself -- we can't derive the category of substance from experience.
- Causality> Hume's critique -- you can never see causality. Kant's claim: in order to see an ordered sequence of events, you have to apply a category of causality to your experience. To experience things happening, you have to in advance apply categories to your experience. 
- Kant calls these forms -- causality, substance, etc. -- Plato's forms -- we don't know where the transcendental ego but it goes into the mind
- One of the things Husserl does is to say that you can actually study these 'transcendental forms' whereas for Kant it is kind of outside of consciousness
- Thing-in-itself interacts with the matter of sensation -- a unity of the matter and the form (back to Aristotle but now the form is in the subject)
- Kant -- principles of synthesis. Kant only really deals with synthesizing temporality in terms of causality. 
- Husserl is not really talking about forms, more about intentional acts.
- Passive synthesis -- in order to see a dog runninng, there needs to be a passive synthesis of protention and retention, you are not deliberately doing it even though you are doing it.
- Active synthesis -- actually doing it, detatching the blue thermos from the blue thermos and re-attaching it -- from seeing a dog running to really seeing "a dog running"
- Most active synthesis are acts of judgement
- als struktur of experience 
- Consciousness is always consciousness of something as something
- Can you be conscious of something not as something? This seems to imply prior active synthesis
- Can we experience the thing not *as something* but *as given*
- Both yes and no; we can distinguish what we perceive it as vs what we simply perceive
