## Week 1 Tuesday -- Introduction to Phenomenology
- Heidegger and Husserl -- an Oedipal story
- Heidegerrian apologism
- Midsommar, Hereditary
- Lonergan -- Jesuit priest, very well educated, a polymath. 
  - Militant Longerganians
  - Jesuit departure from Catholicism: intellectual response to the reformation, a counter-reformation
  - Theory of history which is more informative than Marx and Hegel
  - CHID prgoram developed as in the history of Lonergan
  - Lonergan does phenomenology too -- puts Husserl in the shade?
- Hegel: position, negation, negation of negation
- Nature, sin, grace; progress, decline, redemption
- What is the problem if evil exists on its own? Well God will have created it; evil is therefore the absence of good, since God made good: evil is our failure to desire the good -- evil is something which doesn't happen but which should
- For Lonergan you need a transcendental dimension; for Hegel the synthesis emerges from the dialectic. 
- Hegel doesn't really have a principle of bad: what appears to be bad is setting up for something good
- Same with Marx
- Theodicy -- to justify God -- logical exercises in the goodness of God
- Intentionality -- directedness to an "object"; the ontological status is in question
  - Object: noema, cogitata
  - Our consciousness is always directed towards objects, it is always a consciousness "of"
  - No such thing just as "I'm conscious" -- my consciousness is always directed at some object
  - The *term* of an act of consciousness. I always have a term of consciousness. There is the noesis and the noema.
  - Noesis: from latin, gnosis (knowledge, mental activity); gnoetic -- mental life and activity.
  - English: thinking and the thought -- cogitationes and cogitata
  - There is always pair: never a noema without a noesis and never a noesis without a noema.
  - For any cogitata without a cogitationes, what does that mean? We are never just considering an object without it being observed.
  - Try to think about an object which you aren't thinking about
- Ontology: levels of being. Some ontological questions include, what are the statuses of mathematical vs. physical objects.
- Phenomenology -- phenomena and logos, logos from logein/lire/lesen -- to read off the phenomena
  - Interpreting of the phenomena, whatever happens to be in your experience. Attending to it as it is given to you, irrespective of what it might be independently of you
  - Phenomena / noumena (thing in itself). We don't worry about the noumenal. 
  - Bracketing: don't worry about the noumenal. The epoché. Since in some sense by definition the noumena does not appear
  - Tricks -- there is a way in which the noumena is another phenomena. Constitution -- we constitute the object through our noetic acts.
  - Husserlian term: I see a profile. Every object you see, you never see the backside of it, but you say you see the object. So how does an object exist for you? How does it be an object for you? You constitute it? 
  - I constitute an object because a constitute another subject who views the object. 
  - Compossibility -- compossible intentions, the totality of possibilities have you intended, they are cointended. Overcoming the idea that the nouema is just given to me. The noema is the full object but it is never given to me unless/until I constitute it
  - Intentionality vs cointentionality.
  - There is one cogitata which appears, but there are other cogitata (the backside) which I cointend -- to what extend does it appear to me? As a possibility. 
  - Many problems in philosophy occur from us not really grasping what we have grasped.
- Do children see 3 dimensions? They have some sense of depth perception.
- Principle of conservation, object permanence: you've constituted them as the same. 
- Genetic phenomenology -- generating objects over time. vs. static phenomenology -- already constituted for all of us, but we can trace a geneology of phenomenology.
- Husserl says that Heidegger slips back into the issue by marking epoché as ontological. 
- What about two dimensional depictions? I can be intending the Mona Lisa, but it's an empty intention: the noema is not filling the noesis, not fulfilling the intention. Some objects you can never fulfill the intention. But you can fill it in by anticipating how others will see it. 
- Infinite regress of constitution?
- Epoché, from ancient skepticism: for any claim, you can forulate its opposite, and they are equally powerful (equipolence). We do not know in the face of equipolence, we just cannot judge; right now it appears to me to be sweet. I am not going to make ontological assertions now, though.
  - The act of bracketing the question; what are you? To me *now*, you look to me to be ...
- What is being? What really is? Not what we thought it was.
- What we thought was the noema really is something else.

## Week 1 Thursday -- The Aristotelian and Scholastic Backdrop to Phenomenology
- Husserl - not deeply invested in the history of philosophy, came relatively late
- Often raised philosophical questions about mathematics
- *Eichman in Jeruselem*, Arendt. The banality of evil. Augustin -- evil is a deprivation. Arendt: what is distinct about the 20th century was its banality: its passionlessness, bureaucrats signing papers.
  - Macnumera: fro putting out cars to napalm
  - Evil is no longer an affair of passion but one of abstract technocratic faceless banality
- Eichman on trial: asked "why?" Response: "Just being a good Kantian".
- Talk vs obey. Just obeying orders
- Husserl was responding to Franz Brentano, who did know his HoP. 
- Medeival period -- *Suma Theologia*, Aquinas (summation of theology). Aristotle is 'the philosopher'. 
- Aristotle, then Aquinas, Brentano, then Husserl
- Decartes' meditations on first philosophy. In modernity, first philosophy (foundational philosophy) transformed from metaphysics to epistemology. 
  - For Aristotle: metaphysics is the first philosophy
  - Modernity: epistemology is the first philosophy
- Aristotle: De anima, peri psyche -- on the soul. Deals with what we think are epistemological issues, but articulated here in terms which are established in a larger metaphysical context. 
- When epistemology becomes first philosophy, there is an attempt not to presuppose a first metaphysics until we get clear on the epistemology.
  - Previously: build other things like ethics, politics, study of the soul, logic from metaphysical presuppositions
- Post-Christian baggage of 'soul' not carried with the psyche -- perhaps 'mind'. 
- Quick and dirty of Aristotle: not context for seeing where phenomenology comes from. We can see the natrue of the problem we are responding too.
- Basic Aristotelian metaphysics
  - Potency, form, act
  - Potency -- adult human
  - Form -- shipbuilder
  - Act -- ship building
  - Every adult human is potentially a shipbuilder
  - Potentiality becomes formed, and it is a metaphysical transformation. 
  - Activity of building a ship -- an activity. 
  - Eye, Sight, Seeing
  - What is the relation between form and act? 
  - Metaphysics as the basic constituents of reality
  - Aristotle: a new reality emerges because I am fundamentally in my being different from potency to form
  - Virtue is a form -- only the person who has the form of virtue can act virtuously. 
    - Act must originate from a virtuous form to be virtuous in and of itself: metaphysically virtuous.
  - Shipbuilding is a practical virtue -- virtue as *skill* (e.g. virtuoso)
  - technicality:
    - Potency: first potency
    - Form: first act, second potency
    - Act: second act
  - Acts can become potencies for further acts
  - Another example: human mind, science, understanding/sciencing (a theorem)
    - Human mind as a plate of potentiality
    - Sciencia: knowledge. Science is the actualization of knowledge.
  - Also: potency, form, act -- first nature, second nature, act
  - Phenomenology: the only thing which actually happens is act, because that is what is happening.
  - Form is that by which you act: a first act, but really a potency.
  - An act is a different metaphsycial reality than potency and form. 
  - Aristotle knows about consciousness but it is couched in metaphysical terms which are also applied to things which are not conscious the way we are, such as the growth of a plant or abstract motion. 
  - Three kinds of souls for Aristotle: vegetative, sensitive, and intellectual. 
  - Aristotle -- applies a method of analysis to all souls equally. 
    - Vegetative: life forms
    - Sensitive: conscious forms
    - Intellectual: humans, angels, maybe God
  - Phenomenology: we cannot just have a generic method equally useful for plant life and for human life.
    - Universality and particularity: favoring particularity by phenomenology
  - Aristotle as a 'less sophisticated' even if less brilliant method
  - Undifferentiated -- different realities understood with one method. 
  - A metaphysical analysis of the soul, which is different from what phenomenology does.
  - Maslow gets 'self-actualization' from the Aristotelian "first act, second potency" of form
    - Act: doing the thing which you self-actualize to do
  - Claim: potency is metaphysically improverished, form too. Act is on its own; but potency is on its way to act.
  - Potentiality and actuality will collapse: everything is an actuality. -- Sartre.
  - Potentiality not be: it is potentially something. 
  - Abortion: what is the metaphysical status of the potency of a human fetus (not in act yet)
    - What if potency is real, just not the same reality as act?
  - A plurality of acts become potency for another form. 
  - Actions augment the original potency
  - The soul: for Aristotle, psyche (de anima, from the Scholastics in latin): potens omnia facere et fieri -- the human mind can become anything
    - For Plato, all knowledge is recollected -- we have it in us, we just recollect it; Aristotle says we have all knowledge in us potentially
    - Materia prima, prime matter -- the potency of potencies, just not anything yet, the fundamental potency, it is not anything but it could be something, as opposed to nothingness: potency is not yet anything, but it is not yet nothing. It is potentially something. Sartre says: nah, it's nothing -- potency is nothing.
    - We all can potentially become things: sounds like a God. God is pure act
    - To think through something is to have that reality exist in your cognitive processes. There is no limit, we can become anything, on the spiritual or mental level.
  - Poesis: making something, poetry as the fundamental making.
  - To know something is to become something -- not on the level of matter, but on the level of intentionality. 
  - Lonergan: potency is the principle of limitation, which is why God is pure act
  - But we are potentially infinite. 
  - Metaphysical evil is the failure to be: we are called to come to be, and for some irreason we don't (anxiety, dread -- what do we dread most of all, being? procrastination -- you are about to be something more and you irrationally evade it)
  - Form is what directs act: I know the form of a triangle before I draw it. (But where does the form exist? Not even in y mind, fully)
- Lonergan -- historicized metaphysical categories. 
- Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, Brahe -- acts. Newton -- synthesize into form. Newtonians doing things --- synthesize as Einstein.
  - Evolution: species is latin for form. Individuals doing things (potency) $$\to$$ species (form) $$\to$$ act
- Epistemological turn in modernism with Hegel -- the historical consciousness turn: history is not just static (universal), but there are wide differences in ways of being and this has fundamental epistemological significance. 
  - Archaic Greek did not have a word for acts like seeing or thinking -- did they know that they were seeing or thinkig? Homer: instead of Achilles thought, he says: Achilles deliberated with his horse. Not seeing, but rather Achilles' profile was present to him. 
  - Historicization `<3`
- Two fundamentally different kinds of act: actus imperfecti and actus perfecti.
  - Imperfect act and perfect act
  - Greek: kinesis and energeia
    - Movement and energy
    - Now we think of energy as potency -- but energeia was originally an act. 
  - Movement is metaphysically imperfect act, ontologically incomplete: what it is now is not what it will be, there is a finitude of temporality.
  - Aristotle: the movement through an act towards a term, telos, goal, objective -- the act and the term of the act are distinct. Once the act reaches its term, the act is over. But the movement at any moment is not at any instance what it will be. 
    - Perfective and imperfective verbs in linguistics!!! Completion vs doing
  - Motion is the act of the potential insofar as it remains in potency
  - Motion is the essential becoming; all motion is becoming and all becoming is motion.
  - Categories of change: growth, local, ...
  - Kinesis: all becoming; it is an imperfect reality. An act of the potential still in potency; definitionally on the way.
  - Aristotelian definition of time: the measure of motion. A day is the measure of motion (the Sun). 
  - Mtion as motion is not intrinsically intelligible: just being in motion is not reality, but itself it is not understandable: it needs to reference an origin and an end. 
  - Newtonian physics: motion as motion is not understandable, you instead study the acceleration, the difference which makes a difference, the derivative. motion as motion is really act.
  - We experience it as an intrinsically act on its way to what it will become.
  - Motion is an ontologically inferior reality -- when it is completed it is over. It is also intrinsically temporal. 
  - Perfective: the act and the term of the act are coincident. Hobbes -- human life as the restless pursuit of power after power, ceasing only in death. Life is only motion which ends in death. We don't know how to rest. Life is an imperfect act?
  - Shipbuildinng is a motion -- it is an act, but an imperfective act. Studying is likewise an imperfective act. 
  - Perfect acts: seeing, hearing, tasting, understanding, judging. These are ontologically complete. One is never on the way to seeing: you are either seeing or you are not. You are seeing: it is ontologically coplete in the instance it occurs. Motion is on the other hand always lacking what it will be
  - Perfect acts are intrinsically outside of time. But they are not temporal in the way that motion is temporal. 
  - A motion as complete is over.
  - A tree is spatially different from me, but it is not different from my spatial act of seeing: it is the sense of being perfect, complete, not lacking. The tree is not outside my act of seeing it.
    - Can something be nonspatial but temporal?
  - You are potentially pure act
- The entrance of phenomenology: the act and the object are always coincident: the problem of the bridge, is something outside of me? wrong question: how can affirm something I see is different from me? It is one reality?

```

## Week 2 Tuesday -- Husserl's Introduction to Phenomenology
- Get started on reflection papers
- Discussion leader next week
- Actus imperfecti (kinesis) and actus perfecti (energeia)
- Imperfect act -- motion -- motion is inherently spatial and temporal
- Motion is an intrinsically complete act -- on its way to something else. The completion of the act and the act itself are distinct.
- The act of seeing: the tree you see isn't spatially distinct from your act of seeing. As a perfect act, the act and the term of the act are coincident.
  - You're never on your way to seeing -- either you see or you don't see.
  - The act of seeing persists through time
  - There are always light waves, sound waves, etc. as imperfective acts towards me. But when they reach my eyes I see, i.e. it is the perfective act.
- Once you understand the truth of a sentence, you don't stop understanding it -- it is a complete act
- Imperfective and perfective aspects in grammar
- Potency is not inert -- it anticipates form.
  - Potency -- dunamis, tendency, tending towards
  - Previous acts of understanding become potency for more -- part of a larger dynamism
- Humans are potentially dynamically oriented towards becoming on the level of nous (intellect) all things
- Each act is a partial actualization of this dynamic dimension.
- In our seeing, we are making them more be -- they are not fully what they be until they are comprehended; there is no beauty outside of the act of appreciating; there is no act of being beautiful. There is a sense there in that we only exist when we're known by God. 
- Prime potency -- potentially all things on the level of material reality
- We are potentially all things on the level of intellectual reality
- Prime potency doesn't 'exist' -- something in potency doesn't exist -- things only exist insofar as they have been formed
- Final actualization occurs in the act of appreciating the art itself, which doesn't happen metaphysically unless there is the act of appreication. There is a sense in which we only fully act when we're known...
- When you are in the act, you are fully doing what the act has you do
- You have halfway understood but you have not understood halfway; whereas I can shipbuild halfway
- Unlimited potentiality, a horizon -- which Husserl asserts science strives for.
- Questions are metaphysically bizarre. Meno's parodox: learning is impossible. Either you know something, in which case you can't learn it. Or you don't know something, in which case you can't look for it and don't know where to find it, so you can't learn it.
  - Socrates: we 'unforget' -- we knew everything to begin with. But it's a myth of recollection -- as if we recall things
  - Aha! moment -- that's it, that's sort of like when you forget your keys and you remember where they are.
  - Potency as desire to know is the bizarrest of desires -- asking questions -- you both know and do not know what you are looking for.
  - It's the act of potency insofar as it remains in potency: questions are the act of knowing insofar as it is still in potency
  - Metaphysically, here we have an act which is not fully in act -- a desire to know which is a dynamic orientation
  - When the potentiality is actualized the activity which results is a perfect act; the dynamism of knowing resolves into the perfect act of understanding, as opposed to the dynamism of mere motion (the act ceases).
  - Potency is always anticipatory
- Sense in act is sensed in act -- there may be sound waves but there is no sounding -- it is one act; sounding and hearing are metaphysically the same reality.

| | Subject | Object |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Potency | Human | Tree |
| Form | Faller / striker | Falling / struck |
| Act | Sounding / sound | Sounding / sound |

- "You are the music while the music lasts" -- dancing is not just motion, something more: it is a motion which is formed, and in the full sense it also has to be appreciated. Dance is a unity of motion and act, metaphysically beyond mere motion. There are different ways to be present. You forget about yourself -- in some sense you are the music, and in some sense you are the dance -- there is a sense in which you can render your life as a perfect act in the sense that you are not in agony about the future.
- Intellect in act is intelligible in act -- metaphysically, the act of understanding (intellecting) is not distinct from what is intelligible.
- In order to be, you have to be known. If you're intelligible, to be fully in act, you have to be understood by something
- Hell as God doesn't know you -- you're forgotten
- The dance as motion occurs over time, but as danceit exists throught ime
- Play -- activity for its own sake
- You don't become a tree when you see a tree, but in a sense you do. You take on the form without the matter.
  - Seeing: sensible form without matter
  - Understanding: intelligible form without matter
- Seeing is a fundamental part of your being -- the thing is you, it's making up part of what I am -- it's the form of the thing without the matter.
- The act of seeing isn't really spatial -- the tree is here in the same sense that you see there. We are distinct insofar as we have different matter. 
- Aristotle says form without matter, but we never just experience matter -- so how do we know if there really is anything there?
- This question just didn't get raised -- the critical turn with Decartes through Kant -- how do we know what we experience isn't an illusion?
- We only experience an act -- never potency / matter. If matter is the way by which I am different from others, then I am just me
- Omnipotent -- omni, potency
- On the level of the intelligible, in knowing something, we become that thing. Prime matter can become all things on the material level -- and nous / ego / cogita on the conceptual level.
- We never experience things insofar as they are determinations of our consciousness.
  - Never "out there", always "in here"
- In here / out there -- are distinctions you draw in here -- determinations you've made
- Treat consciousness as a field -- but it's you -- you're not just a body
- Insofar as we can become all things, our ultimate horizon is being. 
- Apodicticity -- known with absolute certainty
- Decartes -- it's impossible to doubt that you're doubting -- it's undubidable insofar as I am doubitng that I be
- It is apodictically certain that I am thinking -- if I try to doubt I am thinking, I am doing thinking
- Decartes was on the way but he gets sidetracked because he carries with him a lot of baggage from the Scholastic tradition which Husserl wants to axe
  - Decartes says "I am a thinking thing" 
  - Substance is the thing which stands underneath or behind the phenomena
  - We are all substances for Aristotle
  - No one experiences substantance as substance -- substance is still a kind of potency underlying it; never an actuality in experience
  - This is where Husserl says Decartes went too far -- a metaphysical reality which is not a phenomena of himself as a thinking substance. I've seen phenomena but nver substance as substance; I have to infer that.
  - Decartes -- if there is thinking, every thing has a substance behind it, so I must be a thikning thing
- We have to start only from the apodictic reality that the activity of thinking is happening. This is what is given in an experience. 
- Intentional existence -- presence of form without matter -- it exists intentionally within us.
- Idea of a substance is not something which is really an object of experience as experienced.
- Bracketing -- stop presupposing an underlying substance.
