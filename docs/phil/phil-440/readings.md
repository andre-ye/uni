## Utilitarianism

### "Welfare, Happiness and the Good", William Shaw
- Utilitarianism: morality is dependent on the outcomes of our actions. 
- Consequences are measured by their benefit for humans (sentient creatures).
- Welfarism: individual welfare should be valued for itself.
- Alternative human values are good only because they contribute to well-being.
- Aristotle: life would be vacuous if all good was good because its true good is commuted to some other object.
- Utilitarians stop the chain of commutation at welfare, well-being: the only thing that is good for people for its own sake.
- Bentham and Mill: equate happiness with pleasure, unhappiness with pain, welfare with happiness.
  - "greatest happiness principle"

**Bentham's Hedonism**
- Bentham: happiness is the enjoyment of pleasure and security from pain.
- Hedonistic doctrine: pleasure is the ONLY absolute good; pain is the ONLY absolute bad.
- Bentham: a crude hedonic calculus?
- Can we compare suffering?
- Good is aggregative: we can derive an overall welfare assessment.

All pleasures are equal
- Bentham holds that all pleasures are equal; there is no intrinsic deviation.
- Complex activities which engage our minds bring us more pleasure in the long term.
- Bentham: we can include malicious or sadistic pleasures, but the pain may outweigh it. 
- "Pleasure is pleasure whatever its nature of source"
- G. E. Moore: it is intrinsically bad to enjoy something evil or ugly.
- J. J. C. Smart: a universe with a deluded sadist is better than one with a deluded mourner
- Can pleasure be anti-utilitarian (rest on the unhappiness of others)?

Animals
- Bentham: we should include the pleasure and pain of animals
- Bentham: the question is not can they reason or talk but can they suffer? (*)
- Many previous moralists like Kant opposed animal curelty on anthropocentric terms.
- Bentham believed that we still could kill animals for food. 
- Utilitarian case against eating meat?
- Narrowing of focus from sentient creatures to humans "affects nothing of philosophical substance"... really?

**Mill's View of Pleasure and Happiness**
- Mill also advocated for hedonism.
- Mill believed that we could rank pleasures; there are higher pleasures.

*Quantity and Quality*
- Appeal to the experience of those who have tried two pleasures of equal pleasure to determine qualitative superiority
- Kinds of pleasures are absolute: it is better to be a dissatisfied human than a satisfied pig.
- Criticisms:
  - We do not know if a pig or a fool has a more pleasurable existence than we do.
  - Inferiority judgements implicitly subscribe to broader utilitarian considerations.
- Does Mill's discourse on higher and lower pleasures repudiate hedonism? We care about things other than pleasure.

*An Expanded Conception of Happiness*
- Mill: A happy life is one with few pains and many pleasures.
- The utilitarian thesis that happiness is the only intrinsic good does not entail people do not desire anything else for its own sake: people might not 'understand what is really important'.
- Happiness is more than the sum of its constituent pleasures
- When someone comes to value something other than happiness in and of itself, it becomes a principal ingredient to that individual's happiness: nothing is desired except happiness.
  - However, this seems like defining happiness to be a vacuous truth.
- Two responses:
  - Sidgwick: no other way to define a coherent and wide theory of happiness.
  - Happiness is closely linked to pleasure.
- We do not necessarily obtain the object of desire for its pleasure, even though we may be made happy by it.

**A Problem for Mental-State Accounts of Well-Being**
- B&M equate well-being with happiness: pleasure in a state of consciousness.
- Is pleasure an experience?
- Pleasure is an action one desires to prolong.
- Classical utilitarianism offers a mental-state account of well-being.
- We might conceive of other mental theories of well-being.
- Is well-being entirely a function of mental life? Idealist thesis: what matters is only how things affect our state of consciousness. What about the state of reality?
- Robert Nozick: technological granted ultimate pleasure. We want to remain in 'reality', we do not want interference by 'artificial machines'. Seems to be but is not really incompatible with mentalism.
- Questioning the idea that machines can even give us experiences indistinguishable from reality.
- Is it right to tell the truth to a happily deceived person?

**Well-Being as the Satisfaction of Desire**
- Bentham: normatively, people bring about what maximizes pleasure.
- What matters is that people satisfy the objects of their desire.
- Economists / game theorists: desires are "preferences"
- Satisfaction doesn't mean one feels satisfied: just that what was desired has been obtained.
- Utilitarianism therefore promotes people getting as much of what they want as they can.
- Desire-satisfaction is the dominant view of welfare among most social scientists and scholars.
  - Modern economic theory: aimed at utility maximization.
  - It doesn't tell people what they should or shouldn't want. (Kind of -- this is questionable.)
  - Makes welfare less psychological than a mental-state theory: we can observe that objects of desire have physically been satisfied.
- Challenges:
  - People's desires change.
  - Desires may be based on false beliefs.
  - A person's desires can be satisfied without them registering it.
  - There is no guarantee that I will enjoy the satisfaction of my desire.
  - Suggests the cultivation of easily satisfied desires.
- Modifications: exclude x undesirable desire
- There is more to well-being than the satisfaction of desire.

**Objective Theories fo Well-Being**
- What should people want, regardless of what they do want?
- Objective-list approach: well-being is a combination of objectively valuable things.
- We should understand good normatively, rather than descriptively.
- Objective-list theorists try to understand what it means for a person to flourish. They make intuitive value judgements.
- John Finnis: knowledge is intrinsically good for us.
- Is scientific or theoretical knowledge valuable even when it cannot be 'used practically'?
- Lists seem to reflect different authors' tastes.
- "Objective-lists" are "subjective-lists"

Perfectionism
- Aristotle:  we should assess an individual's good by the standard of the group "to which they belong".
- Full development of human capacities constitutes an excellent human.
- Nietzsche's perfectionism: ubermensch, the ideal existence. Questionable value judgements.
- Problems:
  - How to identify certain traits as ideal? And do humans even have an essential function(s) or a teleology?
  - Loses contact with the goodness of the individual's life.

Beyond Welfare?
- Perfectionism breaks with utilitarianism's welfarism
- Many philosophers who reject welfarism still hold on to consequentialism
- Goodness of states of affairs are not functions of individual well-being
- Is beauty valuable in and of itself if no one is conscious of it?
- G. E. Moore: isolation to determine value
- Utiltiarians would argue that isolation tests are really hitting at impact on human beings.

**Where This Lack of COnsensus Leaves Utilitarianism**
- Utilitarians judge a person's life to be morally good, even if the overall welfare level is not very high.
- Utilitarians aim to increase general well-being.
- Happiness and mental-state theories emphasize the role of experience in well-being.

*New Directions*
- Mix mental-state and informed desire-satisfaction theoreis of well-being.
- Informed-gratification theory: preferences given full information. Circumvents the experience-machine problem.
- Happiness: not the sense of being happy, but the long-term quality of living a happy life.
- Happiness is a matter of life satisfaction.
- Happiness cannot be a function of conditioning, indoctrination: welfare is "authentic happiness".

*Open-Ended Utilitarianism*
- Philosophers need to draw from human scientists
- Shortcomings in understandings of what is good pose problems for normative domains like law and economics.
- Utilitarianism is still viable as an incomplete theory.
- Utility is complex nad indefinite -- Mill
