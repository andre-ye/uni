## Utilitarianism

### "Welfare, Happiness and the Good", William Shaw
- Utilitarianism: morality is dependent on the outcomes of our actions. 
- Consequences are measured by their benefit for humans (sentient creatures).
- Welfarism: individual welfare should be valued for itself.
- Alternative human values are good only because they contribute to well-being.
- Aristotle: life would be vacuous if all good was good because its true good is commuted to some other object.
- Utilitarians stop the chain of commutation at welfare, well-being: the only thing that is good for people for its own sake.
- Bentham and Mill: equate happiness with pleasure, unhappiness with pain, welfare with happiness.
  - "greatest happiness principle"

**Bentham's Hedonism**
- Bentham: happiness is the enjoyment of pleasure and security from pain.
- Hedonistic doctrine: pleasure is the ONLY absolute good; pain is the ONLY absolute bad.
- Bentham: a crude hedonic calculus?
- Can we compare suffering?
- Good is aggregative: we can derive an overall welfare assessment.

All pleasures are equal
- Bentham holds that all pleasures are equal; there is no intrinsic deviation.
- Complex activities which engage our minds bring us more pleasure in the long term.
- Bentham: we can include malicious or sadistic pleasures, but the pain may outweigh it. 
- "Pleasure is pleasure whatever its nature of source"
- G. E. Moore: it is intrinsically bad to enjoy something evil or ugly.
- J. J. C. Smart: a universe with a deluded sadist is better than one with a deluded mourner
- Can pleasure be anti-utilitarian (rest on the unhappiness of others)?

Animals
- Bentham: we should include the pleasure and pain of animals
- Bentham: the question is not can they reason or talk but can they suffer? (*)
- Many previous moralists like Kant opposed animal curelty on anthropocentric terms.
- Bentham believed that we still could kill animals for food. 
- Utilitarian case against eating meat?
- Narrowing of focus from sentient creatures to humans "affects nothing of philosophical substance"... really?

**Mill's View of Pleasure and Happiness**
- Mill also advocated for hedonism.
- Mill believed that we could rank pleasures; there are higher pleasures.

*Quantity and Quality*
- Appeal to the experience of those who have tried two pleasures of equal pleasure to determine qualitative superiority
- Kinds of pleasures are absolute: it is better to be a dissatisfied human than a satisfied pig.
- Criticisms:
  - We do not know if a pig or a fool has a more pleasurable existence than we do.
  - Inferiority judgements implicitly subscribe to broader utilitarian considerations.
- Does Mill's discourse on higher and lower pleasures repudiate hedonism? We care about things other than pleasure.

*An Expanded Conception of Happiness*
- Mill: A happy life is one with few pains and many pleasures.
- The utilitarian thesis that happiness is the only intrinsic good does not entail people do not desire anything else for its own sake: people might not 'understand what is really important'.
- Happiness is more than the sum of its constituent pleasures
- When someone comes to value something other than happiness in and of itself, it becomes a principal ingredient to that individual's happiness: nothing is desired except happiness.
  - However, this seems like defining happiness to be a vacuous truth.
- Two responses:
  - Sidgwick: no other way to define a coherent and wide theory of happiness.
  - Happiness is closely linked to pleasure.
- We do not necessarily obtain the object of desire for its pleasure, even though we may be made happy by it.

**A Problem for Mental-State Accounts of Well-Being**
- B&M equate well-being with happiness: pleasure in a state of consciousness.
- Is pleasure an experience?
- Pleasure is an action one desires to prolong.
- Classical utilitarianism offers a mental-state account of well-being.
- We might conceive of other mental theories of well-being.
- Is well-being entirely a function of mental life? Idealist thesis: what matters is only how things affect our state of consciousness. What about the state of reality?
- Robert Nozick: technological granted ultimate pleasure. We want to remain in 'reality', we do not want interference by 'artificial machines'. Seems to be but is not really incompatible with mentalism.
- Questioning the idea that machines can even give us experiences indistinguishable from reality.
- Is it right to tell the truth to a happily deceived person?

**Well-Being as the Satisfaction of Desire**
- Bentham: normatively, people bring about what maximizes pleasure.
- What matters is that people satisfy the objects of their desire.
- Economists / game theorists: desires are "preferences"
- Satisfaction doesn't mean one feels satisfied: just that what was desired has been obtained.
- Utilitarianism therefore promotes people getting as much of what they want as they can.
- Desire-satisfaction is the dominant view of welfare among most social scientists and scholars.
  - Modern economic theory: aimed at utility maximization.
  - It doesn't tell people what they should or shouldn't want. (Kind of -- this is questionable.)
  - Makes welfare less psychological than a mental-state theory: we can observe that objects of desire have physically been satisfied.
- Challenges:
  - People's desires change.
  - Desires may be based on false beliefs.
  - A person's desires can be satisfied without them registering it.
  - There is no guarantee that I will enjoy the satisfaction of my desire.
  - Suggests the cultivation of easily satisfied desires.
- Modifications: exclude x undesirable desire
- There is more to well-being than the satisfaction of desire.

**Objective Theories fo Well-Being**
- What should people want, regardless of what they do want?
- Objective-list approach: well-being is a combination of objectively valuable things.
- We should understand good normatively, rather than descriptively.
- Objective-list theorists try to understand what it means for a person to flourish. They make intuitive value judgements.
- John Finnis: knowledge is intrinsically good for us.
- Is scientific or theoretical knowledge valuable even when it cannot be 'used practically'?
- Lists seem to reflect different authors' tastes.
- "Objective-lists" are "subjective-lists"

Perfectionism
- Aristotle:  we should assess an individual's good by the standard of the group "to which they belong".
- Full development of human capacities constitutes an excellent human.
- Nietzsche's perfectionism: ubermensch, the ideal existence. Questionable value judgements.
- Problems:
  - How to identify certain traits as ideal? And do humans even have an essential function(s) or a teleology?
  - Loses contact with the goodness of the individual's life.

Beyond Welfare?
- Perfectionism breaks with utilitarianism's welfarism
- Many philosophers who reject welfarism still hold on to consequentialism
- Goodness of states of affairs are not functions of individual well-being
- Is beauty valuable in and of itself if no one is conscious of it?
- G. E. Moore: isolation to determine value
- Utiltiarians would argue that isolation tests are really hitting at impact on human beings.

**Where This Lack of COnsensus Leaves Utilitarianism**
- Utilitarians judge a person's life to be morally good, even if the overall welfare level is not very high.
- Utilitarians aim to increase general well-being.
- Happiness and mental-state theories emphasize the role of experience in well-being.

*New Directions*
- Mix mental-state and informed desire-satisfaction theoreis of well-being.
- Informed-gratification theory: preferences given full information. Circumvents the experience-machine problem.
- Happiness: not the sense of being happy, but the long-term quality of living a happy life.
- Happiness is a matter of life satisfaction.
- Happiness cannot be a function of conditioning, indoctrination: welfare is "authentic happiness".

*Open-Ended Utilitarianism*
- Philosophers need to draw from human scientists
- Shortcomings in understandings of what is good pose problems for normative domains like law and economics.
- Utilitarianism is still viable as an incomplete theory.
- Utility is complex nad indefinite -- Mill

**Reading Preparation Notes**

Shaw argues that utilitarianism, broadly speaking, is concerned with promoting actions whose outcomes increase well-being. Thinkers have proposed many different understandings of what constitutes well-being, including happiness, pleasure (including repulsive or immoral pleasure), satisfaction of desire, and fulfillment of ‘objective’ collective potential. This disagreement, Shaw asserts, does not render utilitarianism impotent as an applicable ethical theory: there are multiple vectors of development, inside and outside of the site of debate.

Terms
- Pleasure. Pleasure is an individualist mental experience conceptually decorrelated with others’ pleasure. Hedonist utilitarianism is committed to the maximization of aggregated pleasure.
- Well-being. Well-being is an abstracted conceptual attempt to capture what we might want in addition to or beyond the mental domain of pleasure. Well-being considers truth-hood, material realization of desire, and goodness as a function of entities greater than the individual’s mental states.

Comprehension Questions:
- What are objections to Hedonism and what alternative understandings of well-being are proposed?
-	How do different utilitarian thinkers approach contexts in which different members of a social group have antithetical paths towards well-being? (That is, one’s pleasure may be at the expense of another’s pain.)

Philosophical Questions:
- Do theories of utilitarianism need to be descriptively and materially coherent (‘practical’) to truly be normative? In simpler terms: should “should” imply “can”? If the answer is yes, then arguably utilitarian theories which rely upon unmeasurable or otherwise unimplementable ideals should not even be considered ‘real’ normative theories.
- At the conclusion of the article, Shaw declares that philosophers need to draw from the social sciences to develop substantive ethical theories. A question we might ask in response/addition is: how central is ‘intuition’ to the formulation of (utilitarian) ethical theory – even if it is wrapped in many layers of formality – and to what extent is this ethical and/or moral ‘intuition’ already derived from materiality? Can and do mental states and ethical theories exist in a void? To employ Moore’s ‘isolation test’: are ethical theories themselves ‘inherently’ valuable? To what extent does (utilitarian) ethical theory reflect (and possibly perpetuate) the world it was conceived in, and to what extent does it offer the potential for change?

### "Extreme and Unrestricted Utilitarianism", J. J. C. Smart
I
- Utilitarianism: the goodness of actions is to be judged by their consequences.
- Differences in how we interpret what constitutes an action yields two different utilitarianisms.
  - Action as individual actions. Extreme utilitarianism.
  - Action's goodness as determined by falling under a certain rule; the rule's goodness is considered by evaluating the consequences of the rule. Restricted utilitarianism.
- Different distinction from hedonistic and ideal utilitarianism. Extreme/restricted utilitarianism can be hedonistic or ideal.
  - Ideal utilitarianism: pleasure is not even a necessary condition of the good.
- Universalization principle: is it good if everyone does it? -- hypothetical. Is it that one person's action causes others to also do it? -- causal.
- Extreme utilitarianism: causal universalization; restricted utilitarianism: hypothetical form.
- How to approach morality? Not the "milk and water" approach; common morality is superstitious, morally bad, logically confused.

II.
- Extreme utilitarian: moral rules are "rules of thumb"; rules themselves are not sancrosanct
  - To rescue Hitler or not when he is drowning? We can follow rules and justify trusting instincts
  - Extreme utilitarians may praise actions which we 'know to be wrong'
  - Extreme utilitarians may choose to follow moral rules because of lack of time, to avoid personal bias, etc. -- connection with morality of common sense.
- Should an extreme utilitarian propagate extreme utilitarians among the public?

> The extreme utilitarian, then, regards moral rules as rules of thumb and as sociological facts that have to be taken into account when deciding what to do, just as facts of any other sort have to be taken into account. But in themselves they do not justify any action.

III.
- Restricted utilitarian: moral rules are there to short-cuit calculations of consequences.
- Consequences are not relevant in particular cases: only relevant to rules
- Restricted utilitarianism is "monstrous" -- superstitutious worship of the rule
- When would an extreme utilitarian go agains ta conventional moral rule? "For the greater good"
  - Prisoner's dilemmas: what is the harm if just I make a change? "A right action may be rationally condemned"
- What is the duty of an extreme utilitarian in an extreme utilitarian (not a non-utilitarian) society? It is irrational to take the rational choice if you know everyone else will take it.
- Egoistic game theory does not suffice because extreme utilitarians attempt to derive the best outcomes for humanity as a whole.
- Rules are not logical reasons; they must be contextualized to determine whether or not they should be followed.
- Moral rules are rules of thumb only.
- Conceives of ethics as a study of what the most rational action is. 
- In ordinary language, "right" and "wrong" are associated with "praiseworthy" and "unpraiseworthy"

**Reading Preparation Notes**

First, Smart asserts two forms of utilitarianism: ‘extreme utilitarianism’ and  ‘restricted utilitarianism’. The latter, Smart writes, is appealing because it appears to reconcile utilitarianism with intuitionistic accounts of ethical decision-making. Smart argues that restricted utilitarianism encourages irrational adherence to rules, even in cases where they cannot be argued to serve any purpose except their own existence. Given that Smart views ethics as the study of rational (rather than praiseworthy) actions, Smart believes that restricted utilitarianism fails to live up to its normative ethical promise.

Terms
- Extreme utilitarianism. A utilitarian perspective which advocates that rules are merely guidelines and may be violated if the consequences of doing so are favorable. Extreme utilitarianism views rules as potentially useful mechanisms for making quick or less biased ethical decisions in service of a more fundamental entity (preferable outcomes/consequences).
- Restricted utilitarianism. A utilitarian perspective which views rules as strict requirements, to which individual actions must abide by. The rules themselves are subjected generally to a consequentialist judgment. 

Comprehension Questions
- How does Smart address Prisoner’s Dilemma-type problems with extreme utilitarianism and how does his conception of rationality differ from the classical individualist account of rationality employed by “egoistic” game theory?
-	To what extent does the restricted utilitarian believe in the absolute nature of rules? Can restricted utilitarianism be viewed as a modification of extreme utilitarianism in which the unit of agency is relocated from the individual (individuals make decisions depending on the estimated consequences in extreme utilitarianism) to the team (all individuals abide by the same rules), and if so, to what extent are they fundamentally different?(Smart does not give very much real estate towards the justification of restricted utilitarianism, so this point is unclear to me.)

Philosophical Questions
- Throughout the piece, Smart writes about the ‘common man’ as influenced by idealistic worship and pursuing praiseworthiness rather than rationality. That is, the practice of restricted utilitarianism contains an irreducible kernel of unquestionable faith or adherence to a rule. One may ask to what extent all ethical judgements, and perhaps even all philosophical statements, contain this irreducible kernel. 
- What is the metaphysical or ontological status of a rule? Are rules ‘real’, and who is responsible for enforcing them? Are all rules derivatives of ‘natural rules’, and who or what (Nature, God, …) creates these ‘natural rules’?

### "The Case for Longtermism", Greaves & MacAskill

Introduction
- Just how early are we in the history of civilization?
- Most political discussions are centered on the now.
- Longtermism: ensuring the far future goes well, and that it is the most important feature of our contemporary decisions.

Precisifying strong longtermism
- Axiological strong longtermism (ASL): far-future effects are the most important determinant of what we ought to do.
  - Every option that is near-best overall is near-best for the far future.
  - Every option that is near-best overall delivers much larger benefits in the far future than in the near future
- ASL is not concerned with objective value of options and actual effects: rather, focused with predictions.
- ASL only makes comparative claims
- Benefit Ratio (BR): The highest far-future ex ante benefits that are attainable without net near-future harm are many times greater than the highest attainable near-future ex ante benefits.
- Open-minded philanthropist: not limited. Axiological longtermism: the highest-expected value options come from effects more than 100, 1000, etc. years in the future.

A plausibility argument for axiological longtermism
- The size of the future, potentially enormous numbers of future people and other bearers of moral status. 
- If you want to evaluate long term vs short term answers, you need to consider the long term effects. 
- Most entities which control resources pick short-term over long-term low-hanging fruit.
- Axiological longermism is true.

Empirical objection
- There could be complete causal disconnection between the short term and the long term. 
- Washing-out hypotheses: the magnitude of average effects of one's actions decays over time
- Extinction risk mitigation -- totalism: complete well-being. Premature human extinction as very bad. Anything to reduce extinction risk could save more lives than aleviating poverty in the near term.
- Increases the general well-being of the future by speeding up progress or changing the trajectory of progress.
- Speeding up progress: humanity is on upward trajectory. Does longtermism follow? Dependent on the shape of the trajectory.
- Trajectory changes. Attractor states -- moments of temporal gravity. Some political arrangements, agents, climates, value-systems

Axiological objections
- Population axiology
  - Totalism is controversial because it treats currently existing people the same as creating new lives. 
  - Interventions to improve general future well-being: population axiology will agree that the proposition is valuable
- Discounting future welfare
  - Dampens the important of the future
  - Longtermism is false given future-discounting utilitarianism
  - It is not appropriate to discount future lives in this way -- appeals to consensus among moral philosophers
- Non-aggregationism
  - Utilitarianism aggregates well-being across individuals
  - Ex post (possible effects) or ex ante (effect on expected welfare)
- Is it immoral to consider indirect effects?

Deontic longtermism
- Consider someone who doesn't have the explicit goal of longtermism.
- Move towards larger scale organizing boies: result becomes more storngly consequentialist

The scope of longtermism
- Fixed-cause area philanthropy -- what should we do within a cause area
- Career choice

Summary and conclusion
- Axiological longtermism: main question is an empirical one. Is understanding the future sufficiently tractable?
- Invest resources into research to understand tractability in the first place
- Most of longtermism does not presuppose totalism or utilitarianism

**Reading Notes**

Greaves argues for axiological longtermism, an ethical position in which actions which maximize long-term should be pursued over those which only maximize short-term benefits, because the ‘size’ (given by the quantity of beings with moral status) of the far future is much larger than that of the near future. The truthhood of axiological longtermism, Greaves asserts, is not deterred by the empirical or axiological objections. 

Terms and Concepts
- Empirical objection. A category of arguments against axiological longtermism which object to its assumptions on how the near- and far-future behave – for instance, that one’s present actions have decaying or negligible causal influence on the long-term, or that it is intractable to even evaluate such causal influences. Greaves responds by asserting that there are plausible pathways towards changing the world trajectory by shifting the world from one attractor state to another.
- Axiological objection. A category of arguments against axiological longtermism which object to various aspects of its utilitarianism, such as the equation of a small quantity of high-magnitude utility with a high quantity of low-magnitude utility or the aggregation of utility itself. Greaves responds by either asserting that the targets of such objections are not structural to axiological longtermism or that such objections are not strictly relevant to axiological longtermism, although they may concern other forms of longtermism.

Comprehension Questions
-	Greaves asserts that the non-aggregationism is a valid objection against longtermism, but that it targets deontic rather than axiological longtermism. Why exactly is non-aggregationism a matter of choice rather than of outcomes? What is choice but comparison of outcomes? Is this property Greave’s interpretation or inherent to the formulation of non-aggregationism?
-	Exactly why is discounting future welfare generally regarded as an incorrect approach by moral philosophers, and is this appeal to consensus a philosophically sound way to address this objection?

Philosophical Questions
- Given the scarcity of resources, does longtermism deprive the presently oppressed of the means of existence in the name of maximizing the existence and utility of future beings? If this is so, does longtermism participate in an implicit eugenics campaign? 
- Axiological longtermism rests on the assumption that we care about the well-being of future beings, but why should we believe so? How might axiological longtermism reconcile itself with anti-natalist arguments? 

### "Additive Aggregation and The Repugnant Conclusion", Forcehimes & Semaru
Introduction
- To evaluate a group of outcomes, we can not just have knowledge of individual goodness: we need a combinatorial principle. 
- Additive aggregation: the overall value of a complete system is the sum of its individual goodnesses.
- Modeling worlds: individual well-being comes at the cost of population size.
- Repugnant conclusion: additive aggregation makes it such that a world with a large number of moral beings with poor lives is better than a world with a small number of moral beings with good lives.

The Argument from the Repugnant Conclusion
- Welfarism: all episodes of well-being are basically good.
- Welfarism does not force us to arrive at the RC. Equal amounts of well-being are not all equally basically good.
- Proportionalism: the basic goodness of well-being is dependent on its relative reception by the subject.
- The goodness of a complete state of affairs, under the repugnant conclusion, becomes strictly proportional to the total amount of welfare. 
- If the repugnant conclusion is false, then either welfarism, proportionalism, or additive aggregation is false.

The Argument against Additive Aggregation
- Positive lives are good: if well-being exceeds ill-being, then one's existence is good.
- Additive aggregation and positive lives are good arrive at the repugnant conclusion.

The Argument to Accept Repugnance
- Those who deny the repugnant conclusion must also deny additive aggregation.
- What are alternatives to additive aggregation?
- Average view: improve the average state of living. -- avoids the repugnant conclusion. However, it does not take into account population size. World A and populous-World A are equally good.
- Average view must deny that more intrinsic goods are better
- Lexical view: the overall value of a complete system cannot be evaluated on a numerical scale. -- avoids the repugnant conclusion.
  - There are different natures to goodness and badness: lollipops and falling in love, both are good but no amount of lollipops will be as good as the good of falling in love.
  - Lexical view denies the positive life continuity: contribution of each life may not be comparable. But the positive life continuity seems to be necessarily true for gradually decreasing worlds/goods.
  - Lexical dominance requires a critical radical break
- The argument to accept repugnance?

The Argument for the Unreliability of Repugnance
- The Repugnant Conclusion is certainly unwelcome: but is our resistance justified?
- Are our lives like those on World-Z?
- We should not have reason to trust our intuition on the morality of the repugnant conclusion.
- The argument for the unreliability of repugnance

Conclusion
- Additive Aggregation at the root of the Repugnant Conclusion


> As the passage suggests, the rejection of Positive Life Continuity depends on the plausibility of a nonmonistic theory of welfare with incomparable goods. But is such a position defensible?

Response

Forcehimes and Semaru present the Repugnant Conclusion as the assertion that any quantity of people with high quality of life can be outweighed in goodness by a sufficiently larger quantity of people with very low but positive quality of life. They argue that if we accept Additive Aggregation, we must also accept the Repugnant Conclusion. However, alternatives to Additive Aggregation which evade the Repugnant Conclusion force us to accept similarly unintuitive assertions. Lastly, Forcehimes and Semaru speculate that we may not be justified in our reluctance to accept the Repugnant Conclusion.

Terms and Concepts:
- *Additive Aggregation*. The assertion that the value of a system can be quantitatively determined by summing individual positive or negative values. Importantly, Additive Aggregation rejects the lexical position that there are different untraversable types of good and maps all good on a single continuous scale.
- *Positive Life Continuity*. The assertion that sufficiently high quantity of low-welfare lives can always result in a better net goodness than a single high-welfare life. Positive Life Continuity is the core logic of Additive Aggregation and is rejected by the lexical view.

Comprehension Questions
- How do Forcehimes and Semaru infer from proportionalism that each unit of well-being on a world is equal to a unit of ‘basic goodness’ when proportionalism asserts that the goodness of well-being is dependent on the good it provides for its subject and therefore a relative entity? Is the act of asserting goodness in terms of fundamental units already doing ‘part of the work’ of an aggregative/combinatory principle?

Philosophical Questions
- Is it justified to accept a problematic ethical principle if it is the least problematic of ethical principles we can accept? Are we obligated to accept Additive Aggregation because it is arguably optimal compared to averaging or the lexical view, even though it results in the Repugnant Conclusion? If not, then many of the arguments throughout the text which rely upon acceptance of the optimal proposition may not be sound.
- The implicit premise throughout the exploration of Additive Aggregation is that, in the context of moral determination, it acts upon individuals as the core unit of goodness-experiences. Is it possible, however, to apply Additive Aggregation to different units of goodness-experiences, such as families, nations, and body parts, and does such an application contradict with or support an application of Additive Aggregation to individuals?

### "The Non-Identity Problem", Parfit
- Each of us may never have existed -- how do we understand our identity, and future identities?

How our identity in fact depends on when we were conceived
- Time-dependence claim: if any particular person had not been conceived when he was conceived, it is 'in fact' true that he would never have existed.
- The TDC is not true -- it is a reductionist view about personal identity: not about personal identity through time, but identity in different possible histories.
- It is not true that questions of identity must be answered in a binary fashion. Identity may be indeterminate.
- TD2: If any particular person had not been conceived within a month of the time when he was in fact conceived, he would in fact never have existed.
  - In fact true, but not necessarily true
- $$P$$: a distinctive and necessary property.
  - Origin View: each person has a $$P$$ -- growing from a particular pair of cells. But fails to account for identical twins. Compatible with TD2. 
  - Featureless Carteisan View: individuals are particular Cartesian Egos with no $$P$$s.
  - Descriptive View: each person has several $$P$$s, but do not include the origin view.
  - Descriptive Name View: each person's name is associated with particular $$P$$s.
  - Backward Variation View: reference does not need to be the point of origin, but to any point in a person's life -- and maybe we have a different origin.
- Descriptive views: do not account for the different ways in which we live our lives.
  - Reply: properties are not necessary but distinctive.
- Tolstoy: history does not depend on the decisions made by particular people. Author dismisses this view :(
- TDC applies to all views.

The Three Kinds of Choice
- There will be people living later who do not exist now. 
- We can affect identities of future people.
- Would all and only the same people ever live in the same outcomes?
  - Yes: same people choices
  - No: different people choices; would the same number of people ever live in both outcomes?
    - Yes: same number choices
    - No: different number choices

What weight should we give to the interests of future people?
- Most moral thinking is about same people choices
- We can morally ignore different people choices and same/different number choices because we cannot predict them.
- Sometimes we can predict harm.
- Do moral principles only encompass people who can reciprocate? We should reject this.
- Social discount rate, discounting the value of the future.
- SDR is indefensible, Parfit argues. 
- Can we conceive of time as a spatial dimension, just like shooting an arrow?

A young girl's child
- Future people:
  - Will future people have a life worth living?
  - Do we benefit the person if an act of ours is a necessary part of their existence?
- Non-Identity problem: in different outcomes, different people would be born.
- We use the phrases 'her child' to cover any child whicht he girl may have, but she has different children.
- Same number quality claim, Q

How lowering the quality of life might be worse for no one
- Different polices will affect who marries who, and what children will come out.
- The problem of depletion: we must choose which resources to deplete.
- If particular people live lives that are worth livign, is it worse for these people than if they had never existed? -- **No.** It does not matter what decision we make -- we will benefit all future people
- One idea: what is bad must be bad for someone. But we should not morally choose depletion. 
- Non-identity problem: the identities of people in the further future can be easily influenced. While it arises superficially in terms of reproduction, it is also real: it is not true that the same people exist.

Why an appeal to rights cannot wholly solve the problem
- 14-y/o girl: every child has a right to a good start in life, which this girl is violating by choosing to give birth to him early.
- Even if a child has a right, it can not be fulfilled at a later point in time.
- We often waive rights: we do not expect them always to be fulfilled.
- The mother should have waited, not because of some innate right, but because of what she could have done.
- People do not have rights to a share of some resource.
- We cause people to exist with rights that cannot be fulfilled.
- Are you glad to be alive? Perhaps you waive the violation of your rights
- Is utilitarianism a theory of rights? Rights rather constrain the principle of utility; principle of beneficence (theory X)

Does the fact of non-identity make a moral difference?
- Do our choices make a moral difference if our choice is worse for no one?
- No-difference view: no difference between accepting and rejecting the non-identity problem.
- Accept the No-Difference View: causing someone to exist with a life worth living benefitss this person.
- Two views:
  - Person-affecting view: V
  - It would be bad if the same number of people would live and the ones who do live worse off than those who would have lived.
- V is wrong -- draws moral distinctions where no moral distinctions should be drawn. 
- In Same People Choices, $$Q = V$$. For Same Number Choices, they conflict and we shoulda ccept $$Q$$ over $$V$$.
- X and V will conflict when we make same and different number choices. 
- Causing to exist cannot benefit.

Causing predictable catastrophes in the further future
- The non-identity problem cannot be solved by an appeal to rights
- If people live lives that are worse living, our choice for the risky policy is worse for no one.
- "A choice cannot have a bad effect if the choice is bad for no one" -- disproven by the risky policy
- We may have harmed these people even though our choice is not worse for people struck by the catastrophe.
- We can deserve blame for harming others, even when i tis not worse for them.
- To assign blame, we need to consider predictable and not actual effects.
- Criticism based on beliefs stand even if our belief is false.
  - What is the real nature of this criticism?
- Maybe the best thing to do is to conceal the non-identity problem: perhaps it is better that people believe falsely.
- Consent and infringements to autonomy
- People who owe their existence to choices
- We can easily affect the identities of future people.
- Depletion can be bad even though it is worse for no one.

Responses

Utilitarian evaluations of decisions which have disparate outcomes in the future often treat the people in question as if their identities remain the same across all actions. However, Parfit argues that such evaluations run into the non-identity problem: an individual’s identity is specific to their biological conditions of origination, and therefore no individual existing in the sufficiently far future from action A could also exist in the sufficiently far future from action B. It is then possible that enacting a decision which only reduces the quality of life of future individuals (while still being worth living) is not harmful to anyone, because otherwise these individuals would not exist. Parfit asserts that an argument for rights does not solve the non-identity problem because we can still prefer to live overall well-off lives with some violated rights than to not exist. Lastly, Parfit suggests that a (mysterious) Theory X is needed to understand decisions which affect both different types and quantities of people in the future, which will truly solve the non-identity problem.

Terms and Concepts
- Time-dependence claim. An individual’s identity is unique to the time at which they are conceived, such that an individual which hypothetically was not conceived at the time in which they really were conceived does not exist. Parfit argues that multiple views on the status of identity are all compatible with the time-dependence claim.
- Q (Same number quality claim). Given two distinct actions in a decision affect the same number of people who would be brought into existence, then it is bad if the people who are brought into existence by an action live worse off than if another action was chosen and they never existed. Parfit argues that Q does not solve the non-identity problem because it does not handle cases in which different types or numbers of people can be affected.

Comprehension Question
- Parfit writes that the non-identity problem, while arising from ‘superficial’ features of human reproductive biology, is still a ‘real problem’. I have trouble understanding how: Parfit is writing in the domain of deciding between two social or economic policies, so why does he focus on a biologically oriented conception of identity rather than a socially or economically informed one? What is Parfit’s argument that the non-identity problem is significant to the difficult issues he attempts to apply it to?

Philosophical Questions
- Is an individual which would have been conceived at some point in time but was not of the same status of inexistence as an individual who never was going to be conceived at any time (of which there are theoretically infinitely many)? If there is a difference, then how is it that our intentions constitute a different form of inexistence?
- Throughout his numerous examples, Parfit assumes that the adverse effects of a current decision on a future individual’s life can be isolated from the well-being that said individual has been defined as having. But is this a reasonable assumption? – is it not that knowing about such adverse effects can cause serious psychological harm, and that we are much more attuned to the ills and injustices done upon us than the good we reap from the world?

## Contractualism

### *The Structure of Contractualism*, Scanlon
Introduction
- An act is right iff it can be justified to others
- Justifiability is elementary: it is the normative basis of morality.
- Contractualism: when we decide morality, we decide firstly which principles cannot be reasonably rejected.
- Alternative views: appeal to rationality.
  - Gauthier: rationality is the fulfillment of one's aims
  - Hare: rationality is maximum satisfaction of present preferences as conforming to truth
  - Kant: actions are morally if it can hold as a universal law
  - Rawls: veil of ignorance
- Thee theories: we can reach conclusions by asking what is rational or note. We hasve to consider the interests of others.
- Contractualism  -- finding principles which could not be reasonably rejected.
- Appeals to reasonableness rather than rationality.

Reasonableness
- What does it mean to reasonable?
- The distinction between reasonable and rational actions is semantically significantly. 
- Rationality in group reasoning yields more complex answers in realistic scenarios where gain comes at a cost.
- Deciding on the right or wrong of an action requires a judgement on whether objections to moral principles are reasonable.
- Reasonability is not about advancing interests or producing agreements, but on th suitability of principles.
- Reasonability guides our common morality; it has moral content.
- Is reasonability a circular theory? We put in moral elements to get morality? 
- Is it wrong to do X in circumstances C? Consider if a principle which allows one to do X in C can be rejected.
- Concept: a threshold of reasonable rejection. This is generally incorrect.
- How do we deal with evenly balanced strong objections from opposing parties?
- Objections are symmetrical, and allow us to derive unrejectable principles.

Principles
- An act is wrong if it would be disallowed by a principle that no one could reasonably reject. 
- What is a principle?
- Act and rule utilitarianism
- Why should we understand actions through principles to begin with? To justify an action is always to defend a principle.
- Contractualism heavily emphasizes the rule of justification. -- an act is wrong not just because it is, but for some reason.
- We rarely see that an action is wrong without knowing why. (Is this really treu though?)
- What is a principle? They are general conclusions about the status of various kinds of reasons for action. They leave room for interpretation -- otherwise it would be too narrow and there would be few moral principles.
- Familiar moral principles are succint labels for more complex ideas. But also, what are the areas wide principles cover which people agree on?
  - In making judgements, we draw upon these understandings.
- How many valid moral principles are there? Scanlon says an infinite number.

Standpoints
- Are there standpoints other than our own from which principles we consider can be reasonably rejected?
- What is a standpoint?
- We need an abstractperspective -- we need to take into account consequences of actions and other implications -- we need many individuals' perspectives.
- Acts can have different effects on  individuals -- especially because they may trigger or not trigger other actions.
- We must rely on commonly available information -- generic reasons.
- Reasonable rejection is dependent on alternatives
- We experience a pressure to make principles more fine-grained. But these also create greater uncertainty.
- Moral theory -- correct biases. Justifying our actions to others helps to gradually refine intuitive moral categories.

Generality and Fairness
- It is natural to take into account the likelihood that a person will benefit or suffer from a principle. How to respond?
  - Those who cannot benefit should more wholly register the concerns of the benefactors.
  - How to take others into account? If one needs it, should one be called upon to do so, generic costs, generic benefits
- Two actions may differ in harm is not consequentialist; we can accept prohibiton against intentionally inflicting serious harm.
- Moral principles and proper names? Exclusions and generality?
  - Rawls: veil of ignorance
  - Hare: moral principles may contain no proper names. But we cannot tell if they are 'rigged' or not.
