## Utilitarianism

### "Welfare, Happiness and the Good", William Shaw
- Utilitarianism: morality is dependent on the outcomes of our actions. 
- Consequences are measured by their benefit for humans (sentient creatures).
- Welfarism: individual welfare should be valued for itself.
- Alternative human values are good only because they contribute to well-being.
- Aristotle: life would be vacuous if all good was good because its true good is commuted to some other object.
- Utilitarians stop the chain of commutation at welfare, well-being: the only thing that is good for people for its own sake.
- Bentham and Mill: equate happiness with pleasure, unhappiness with pain, welfare with happiness.
  - "greatest happiness principle"

**Bentham's Hedonism**
- Bentham: happiness is the enjoyment of pleasure and security from pain.
- Hedonistic doctrine: pleasure is the ONLY absolute good; pain is the ONLY absolute bad.
- Bentham: a crude hedonic calculus?
- Can we compare suffering?
- Good is aggregative: we can derive an overall welfare assessment.

All pleasures are equal
- Bentham holds that all pleasures are equal; there is no intrinsic deviation.
- Complex activities which engage our minds bring us more pleasure in the long term.
- Bentham: we can include malicious or sadistic pleasures, but the pain may outweigh it. 
- "Pleasure is pleasure whatever its nature of source"
- G. E. Moore: it is intrinsically bad to enjoy something evil or ugly.
- J. J. C. Smart: a universe with a deluded sadist is better than one with a deluded mourner
- Can pleasure be anti-utilitarian (rest on the unhappiness of others)?

Animals
- Bentham: we should include the pleasure and pain of animals
- Bentham: the question is not can they reason or talk but can they suffer? (*)
- Many previous moralists like Kant opposed animal curelty on anthropocentric terms.
- Bentham believed that we still could kill animals for food. 
- Utilitarian case against eating meat?
- Narrowing of focus from sentient creatures to humans "affects nothing of philosophical substance"... really?

**Mill's View of Pleasure and Happiness**
- Mill also advocated for hedonism.
- Mill believed that we could rank pleasures; there are higher pleasures.

*Quantity and Quality*
- Appeal to the experience of those who have tried two pleasures of equal pleasure to determine qualitative superiority
- Kinds of pleasures are absolute: it is better to be a dissatisfied human than a satisfied pig.
- Criticisms:
  - We do not know if a pig or a fool has a more pleasurable existence than we do.
  - Inferiority judgements implicitly subscribe to broader utilitarian considerations.
- Does Mill's discourse on higher and lower pleasures repudiate hedonism? We care about things other than pleasure.

*An Expanded Conception of Happiness*
- Mill: A happy life is one with few pains and many pleasures.
- The utilitarian thesis that happiness is the only intrinsic good does not entail people do not desire anything else for its own sake: people might not 'understand what is really important'.
- Happiness is more than the sum of its constituent pleasures
- When someone comes to value something other than happiness in and of itself, it becomes a principal ingredient to that individual's happiness: nothing is desired except happiness.
  - However, this seems like defining happiness to be a vacuous truth.
- Two responses:
  - Sidgwick: no other way to define a coherent and wide theory of happiness.
  - Happiness is closely linked to pleasure.
- We do not necessarily obtain the object of desire for its pleasure, even though we may be made happy by it.

**A Problem for Mental-State Accounts of Well-Being**
- B&M equate well-being with happiness: pleasure in a state of consciousness.
- Is pleasure an experience?
- Pleasure is an action one desires to prolong.
- Classical utilitarianism offers a mental-state account of well-being.
- We might conceive of other mental theories of well-being.
- Is well-being entirely a function of mental life? Idealist thesis: what matters is only how things affect our state of consciousness. What about the state of reality?
- Robert Nozick: technological granted ultimate pleasure. We want to remain in 'reality', we do not want interference by 'artificial machines'. Seems to be but is not really incompatible with mentalism.
- Questioning the idea that machines can even give us experiences indistinguishable from reality.
- Is it right to tell the truth to a happily deceived person?

**Well-Being as the Satisfaction of Desire**
- Bentham: normatively, people bring about what maximizes pleasure.
- What matters is that people satisfy the objects of their desire.
- Economists / game theorists: desires are "preferences"
- Satisfaction doesn't mean one feels satisfied: just that what was desired has been obtained.
- Utilitarianism therefore promotes people getting as much of what they want as they can.
- Desire-satisfaction is the dominant view of welfare among most social scientists and scholars.
  - Modern economic theory: aimed at utility maximization.
  - It doesn't tell people what they should or shouldn't want. (Kind of -- this is questionable.)
  - Makes welfare less psychological than a mental-state theory: we can observe that objects of desire have physically been satisfied.
- Challenges:
  - People's desires change.
  - Desires may be based on false beliefs.
  - A person's desires can be satisfied without them registering it.
  - There is no guarantee that I will enjoy the satisfaction of my desire.
  - Suggests the cultivation of easily satisfied desires.
- Modifications: exclude x undesirable desire
- There is more to well-being than the satisfaction of desire.

**Objective Theories fo Well-Being**
- What should people want, regardless of what they do want?
- Objective-list approach: well-being is a combination of objectively valuable things.
- We should understand good normatively, rather than descriptively.
- Objective-list theorists try to understand what it means for a person to flourish. They make intuitive value judgements.
- John Finnis: knowledge is intrinsically good for us.
- Is scientific or theoretical knowledge valuable even when it cannot be 'used practically'?
- Lists seem to reflect different authors' tastes.
- "Objective-lists" are "subjective-lists"

Perfectionism
- Aristotle:  we should assess an individual's good by the standard of the group "to which they belong".
- Full development of human capacities constitutes an excellent human.
- Nietzsche's perfectionism: ubermensch, the ideal existence. Questionable value judgements.
- Problems:
  - How to identify certain traits as ideal? And do humans even have an essential function(s) or a teleology?
  - Loses contact with the goodness of the individual's life.

Beyond Welfare?
- Perfectionism breaks with utilitarianism's welfarism
- Many philosophers who reject welfarism still hold on to consequentialism
- Goodness of states of affairs are not functions of individual well-being
- Is beauty valuable in and of itself if no one is conscious of it?
- G. E. Moore: isolation to determine value
- Utiltiarians would argue that isolation tests are really hitting at impact on human beings.

**Where This Lack of COnsensus Leaves Utilitarianism**
- Utilitarians judge a person's life to be morally good, even if the overall welfare level is not very high.
- Utilitarians aim to increase general well-being.
- Happiness and mental-state theories emphasize the role of experience in well-being.

*New Directions*
- Mix mental-state and informed desire-satisfaction theoreis of well-being.
- Informed-gratification theory: preferences given full information. Circumvents the experience-machine problem.
- Happiness: not the sense of being happy, but the long-term quality of living a happy life.
- Happiness is a matter of life satisfaction.
- Happiness cannot be a function of conditioning, indoctrination: welfare is "authentic happiness".

*Open-Ended Utilitarianism*
- Philosophers need to draw from human scientists
- Shortcomings in understandings of what is good pose problems for normative domains like law and economics.
- Utilitarianism is still viable as an incomplete theory.
- Utility is complex nad indefinite -- Mill

**Reading Preparation Notes**

Shaw argues that utilitarianism, broadly speaking, is concerned with promoting actions whose outcomes increase well-being. Thinkers have proposed many different understandings of what constitutes well-being, including happiness, pleasure (including repulsive or immoral pleasure), satisfaction of desire, and fulfillment of ‘objective’ collective potential. This disagreement, Shaw asserts, does not render utilitarianism impotent as an applicable ethical theory: there are multiple vectors of development, inside and outside of the site of debate.

Terms
- Pleasure. Pleasure is an individualist mental experience conceptually decorrelated with others’ pleasure. Hedonist utilitarianism is committed to the maximization of aggregated pleasure.
- Well-being. Well-being is an abstracted conceptual attempt to capture what we might want in addition to or beyond the mental domain of pleasure. Well-being considers truth-hood, material realization of desire, and goodness as a function of entities greater than the individual’s mental states.

Comprehension Questions:
- What are objections to Hedonism and what alternative understandings of well-being are proposed?
-	How do different utilitarian thinkers approach contexts in which different members of a social group have antithetical paths towards well-being? (That is, one’s pleasure may be at the expense of another’s pain.)

Philosophical Questions:
- Do theories of utilitarianism need to be descriptively and materially coherent (‘practical’) to truly be normative? In simpler terms: should “should” imply “can”? If the answer is yes, then arguably utilitarian theories which rely upon unmeasurable or otherwise unimplementable ideals should not even be considered ‘real’ normative theories.
- At the conclusion of the article, Shaw declares that philosophers need to draw from the social sciences to develop substantive ethical theories. A question we might ask in response/addition is: how central is ‘intuition’ to the formulation of (utilitarian) ethical theory – even if it is wrapped in many layers of formality – and to what extent is this ethical and/or moral ‘intuition’ already derived from materiality? Can and do mental states and ethical theories exist in a void? To employ Moore’s ‘isolation test’: are ethical theories themselves ‘inherently’ valuable? To what extent does (utilitarian) ethical theory reflect (and possibly perpetuate) the world it was conceived in, and to what extent does it offer the potential for change?

### "Extreme and Unrestricted Utilitarianism", J. J. C. Smart
I
- Utilitarianism: the goodness of actions is to be judged by their consequences.
- Differences in how we interpret what constitutes an action yields two different utilitarianisms.
  - Action as individual actions. Extreme utilitarianism.
  - Action's goodness as determined by falling under a certain rule; the rule's goodness is considered by evaluating the consequences of the rule. Restricted utilitarianism.
- Different distinction from hedonistic and ideal utilitarianism. Extreme/restricted utilitarianism can be hedonistic or ideal.
  - Ideal utilitarianism: pleasure is not even a necessary condition of the good.
- Universalization principle: is it good if everyone does it? -- hypothetical. Is it that one person's action causes others to also do it? -- causal.
- Extreme utilitarianism: causal universalization; restricted utilitarianism: hypothetical form.
- How to approach morality? Not the "milk and water" approach; common morality is superstitious, morally bad, logically confused.

II.
- Extreme utilitarian: moral rules are "rules of thumb"; rules themselves are not sancrosanct
  - To rescue Hitler or not when he is drowning? We can follow rules and justify trusting instincts
  - Extreme utilitarians may praise actions which we 'know to be wrong'
  - Extreme utilitarians may choose to follow moral rules because of lack of time, to avoid personal bias, etc. -- connection with morality of common sense.
- Should an extreme utilitarian propagate extreme utilitarians among the public?

> The extreme utilitarian, then, regards moral rules as rules of thumb and as sociological facts that have to be taken into account when deciding what to do, just as facts of any other sort have to be taken into account. But in themselves they do not justify any action.

III.
- Restricted utilitarian: moral rules are there to short-cuit calculations of consequences.
- Consequences are not relevant in particular cases: only relevant to rules
- Restricted utilitarianism is "monstrous" -- superstitutious worship of the rule
- When would an extreme utilitarian go agains ta conventional moral rule? "For the greater good"
  - Prisoner's dilemmas: what is the harm if just I make a change? "A right action may be rationally condemned"
- What is the duty of an extreme utilitarian in an extreme utilitarian (not a non-utilitarian) society? It is irrational to take the rational choice if you know everyone else will take it.
- Egoistic game theory does not suffice because extreme utilitarians attempt to derive the best outcomes for humanity as a whole.
- Rules are not logical reasons; they must be contextualized to determine whether or not they should be followed.
- Moral rules are rules of thumb only.
- Conceives of ethics as a study of what the most rational action is. 
- In ordinary language, "right" and "wrong" are associated with "praiseworthy" and "unpraiseworthy"

**Reading Preparation Notes**

First, Smart asserts two forms of utilitarianism: ‘extreme utilitarianism’ and  ‘restricted utilitarianism’. The latter, Smart writes, is appealing because it appears to reconcile utilitarianism with intuitionistic accounts of ethical decision-making. Smart argues that restricted utilitarianism encourages irrational adherence to rules, even in cases where they cannot be argued to serve any purpose except their own existence. Given that Smart views ethics as the study of rational (rather than praiseworthy) actions, Smart believes that restricted utilitarianism fails to live up to its normative ethical promise.

Terms
- Extreme utilitarianism. A utilitarian perspective which advocates that rules are merely guidelines and may be violated if the consequences of doing so are favorable. Extreme utilitarianism views rules as potentially useful mechanisms for making quick or less biased ethical decisions in service of a more fundamental entity (preferable outcomes/consequences).
- Restricted utilitarianism. A utilitarian perspective which views rules as strict requirements, to which individual actions must abide by. The rules themselves are subjected generally to a consequentialist judgment. 

Comprehension Questions
- How does Smart address Prisoner’s Dilemma-type problems with extreme utilitarianism and how does his conception of rationality differ from the classical individualist account of rationality employed by “egoistic” game theory?
-	To what extent does the restricted utilitarian believe in the absolute nature of rules? Can restricted utilitarianism be viewed as a modification of extreme utilitarianism in which the unit of agency is relocated from the individual (individuals make decisions depending on the estimated consequences in extreme utilitarianism) to the team (all individuals abide by the same rules), and if so, to what extent are they fundamentally different?(Smart does not give very much real estate towards the justification of restricted utilitarianism, so this point is unclear to me.)

Philosophical Questions
- Throughout the piece, Smart writes about the ‘common man’ as influenced by idealistic worship and pursuing praiseworthiness rather than rationality. That is, the practice of restricted utilitarianism contains an irreducible kernel of unquestionable faith or adherence to a rule. One may ask to what extent all ethical judgements, and perhaps even all philosophical statements, contain this irreducible kernel. 
- What is the metaphysical or ontological status of a rule? Are rules ‘real’, and who is responsible for enforcing them? Are all rules derivatives of ‘natural rules’, and who or what (Nature, God, …) creates these ‘natural rules’?

### "The Case for Longtermism", Greaves & MacAskill

Introduction
- Just how early are we in the history of civilization?
- Most political discussions are centered on the now.
- Longtermism: ensuring the far future goes well, and that it is the most important feature of our contemporary decisions.

Precisifying strong longtermism
- Axiological strong longtermism (ASL): far-future effects are the most important determinant of what we ought to do.
  - Every option that is near-best overall is near-best for the far future.
  - Every option that is near-best overall delivers much larger benefits in the far future than in the near future
- ASL is not concerned with objective value of options and actual effects: rather, focused with predictions.
- ASL only makes comparative claims
- Benefit Ratio (BR): The highest far-future ex ante benefits that are attainable without net near-future harm are many times greater than the highest attainable near-future ex ante benefits.
- Open-minded philanthropist: not limited. Axiological longtermism: the highest-expected value options come from effects more than 100, 1000, etc. years in the future.

A plausibility argument for axiological longtermism
- The size of the future, potentially enormous numbers of future people and other bearers of moral status.
