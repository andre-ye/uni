## Week 1 Thursday: Well-Being
- What is distinctive of utilitarianism is that happiness is the only good, the only thing which matters for its own sake.
  - Are there other forms of pure good?
  - A weakness of utilitarianism? The only pure good?
- Utilitarianism -- the morally right act of policy is the one which produces the greatest happiness for members of society.
- Utilitarianism is a tacit background upon which other theories assert and defend themselves
- Many areas of economics, law, and public policy use utilitarian thinking.
- Attractions
  - Intuition: well-being matters
  - Intuition: moral rules must be evaluated on consequences
  - Guides our actions: an argmax
  - Seems to be clear and transparent
  - Seems to be corrective over time: gives us a way of resisting mindless repetition or superstition
- Does utilitarianism really work, deliver its promises?
  - WK: intuitions are good, but other theories do a better job of explaining theem. Other theories can do a better job.
  - There are many versions of utilitarianism, and internal conflict
  - Steve Gardiner dilemma:
    - Direct, clear implications -- but implausible
    - Indirect, unclear implications -- but more plausible
  - Six specific objections: pig philosophy, abhorrent actions, demandingness, separateness of persons, politics, psychology
- Pig philosophy: Hedonistic focus of pleasure excludes important non-pleasures and includes Sadistic or immoral pleasures.
- Three major components of utilitarianism
  - Consequentialism: the right thing to do is to bring about as much good as possible
  - Impartiality: all goods are counted equally
  - Welfarism: what is good is well-being and happiness only
- "utility" as a treacherous term: usefulness, pleasure, happiness, benefit, well-being, preference-satisfaction, choices (revealed preference)
- Philosophical welfarism: utility is well-being (theoretical heart of welfarism). Many varieties:
  - Mental state theories -- hedonism, experiential
  - Desire-satisfaction
  - Objective accounts
- Simple Hedonist view -- all pleasure is the same, but we only find differences in quantity of pleasure. Everything that matters only matters because of its ability to produce pleasure.
  - Orgasmitron -- gives you as much pleasure as you can have for as long as you can have it. This is the best life for a human being. 
- Objection: simple Hedonism is beneath us! Makes us slavish, pig philosophy (Voltaire, Aristotle, Nietzsche)
- Bentham's calculus: valuing different pleasures by intensity, duration, certainty, remoteness
- Objection: pleasures are not all of one kind. Hadyn and the oyster. Short Hadyn life or indefinite oyster life? If you choose Hadyn, it defeats simple quantiative Hedonism. Need to account for different qualities of pleasure.
- Experience machine: from Nozick, is living in the device better than living outside 'in reality'? Plugging into the machine is a form of suicide. Other things than our experiences matter: reality, agency...
  - Shaw disagrees, the deathbed lie -- white lies.
- Desire-satisfaction accounts: what are actual vs. true preferences?
  - What do people actually want?
  - Give people what they would want if they were truly informed
- Substantive content. The grass counter objection: can a good life be one counting grass? Crisp: this is no good life to live.
- Shape: Callicle's Vision. Socrates thinking about the desire-satsifaction principle: allow appetites to grow as large as possible, then to devote himself to them with intelligence and bravery. Cultivate things you want and go to achieve desire satisfaction. Socrates responds (rudely): the life of a stone curlew -- eat and poops its entire life. The itchy life. Leaky bucket: pour satisfaction in constantly.
  - What solutions? Adaptive preferences and self-sufficient goods

## Week 2 Tuesday: Act vs. Rule
- Goal -- to get people up to speed on utilitarianism, helps us also understand other theories and also for utilitarianism by itself.
- Longtermism - act utilitarianism applied to the long-term. (Crudely put)
- End of week, should decide presentation groups.
- Common flaws -- being sloppy about stating philosophical terms. 
- Utilitarianism has a strong historical role: changes social systems in the West to better promote utility
- Traditionally, utilitarianism was a project of social reformers. 
- More recently, utilitarianism has a mixed reputation. Expectations are dependent / constructed by certain areas of society. Seen as a regressive rather than a progressive approach.
- Cost-benefit analysis: used by contemporary economics: only do things if they have higher benefits than costs. 
- The rights objection
- A classical problem: the body parts case. Suppose you are a transplant surgeon. You have 5 patients: one needs a kidney, another needs a heart, liver, etc. You don't have them. Can you use the body parts of a destitute person with no prospects?
  - Utilitarianism doesn't take rights or the individual seriously. You are a resource for others -- and that is why you are important.
- Responses
  - Response #1: further consequences. People will find out what you did and people will stop going to hospitals, etc. - real consequences will be worse for the 'real world'. Argument: act utilitarianism wouldn't tell you to cut up the destitute man.
  - Response #2: rule of thumb. A principle with broad application. 
  - Smart's extreme utilitarianism -- we must never forget that act utilitarianism is always lurking in the background. 
- Rules of morality "for the multitude"
  - Signposts
  - Historical knowledge
- Fundamental challenge: counter-intuitive?
- Rule utilitarianism  -- we change our view of what kind of utilitarian we should be. What rules should we use in society?
  - People should not be act utilitarians in their daily lives.
  - Two-tier evaluation - government house utilitarianism; 'rule worship', collapse. 
  - Response #4: So much the worse for common moral consciousness! You don't want to cut up the destitute man only because of common morality.
- Worries -- leads to shocking results, how to test general ethical principles 
- Mill's error theory: common sense moral rules are grounded already in utilitarianism -- just an imperfect version, but it is always lurking there.
