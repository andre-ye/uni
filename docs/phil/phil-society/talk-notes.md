## "Vigilantism by Proxy: Whiteness, Superagency, and Institutional Power" by Cody Dout
Given 12/3/21 in Smith Hall, Room 305.

- Annoyance crossing the Burke Gilman trail as a car. Are there stop signs? Why don't bikers stop?
- Framework to explain and understand racism.
- Addressing only policy and such does not prove fruitful. Not interested in stopping *racism*, but stopping racist outcomes.
- Most common social advocacy organizations and uni students - a structuralist/political view. Makes it more comfortable for the dominant culture/majority to talk about racism. Racism without racists; absence of racists; rules and policies.
- Moral view - less common and probably more accurate. Mainly only heard from the right-wing.
- Both advocate for one position almost exclusively. 

### Structuralist View
- Young - seen as the end-all-be-all of the structuralist view.

> The concept of social structure must include the outcome of collective action.

- Effects beyond immediate purposes, generally well meaning.
- Past actions and policies constrain future choices.
- We all engage in daily lives, interacting with constraints and stuff because of policy, etc. Out of these complex interactions, we have racist outcomes.
- Actions are removed from racist outcomes; culpability is diluted. Even if you contribute to racism, your actions are constrained and you are not morally responsible.
- The way how others act in the past impact you, etc.; another layer of removed moral culpability.
- Assumes widespread compliance.
- Perspective of changing unjust outcomes by changing policy/legislation.
- Open texture - legal philosophy. Things are open to interpretation.
- Any time you release a policy, what matters is how it is interpreted.
  - If we allow for interpretation, then we will obtain a more just society.
- Want to consider bad actions norms, etc. - the open texture, open to how anyone wants to interpret it.

### Moralist View
- Racism stems from individual attitudes.
- Explains the origination, development, and maintenance of racist institutional policies.
- Usually accompanied by a corresponding denial of structural influence.
- Emergent qualities
- Implicit bias test
- What does it look like when someone is consciously vs unconsciously racist? It's the same.

### Compromise View
- Moralist view: perpetuation is through racist attitudes infecting policies. Policies infect the attitudes of others. Suggested theory still hinger moralist perspective on policy.
- Structural view: 2016 election, racism shaped by social context. Belief that explicit racism is on the decline. Political victories enable explicit outburst. 
- Origination of racist institutions
  - Originatino of slavery in America
  - Suggested slavery led to race, rather than vice versa.
  - Genealogical view - identifies cause rather than conditions; explains institutions, attitudes, and perpetuation.
- Perhaps racism existed before slavery. Shakespeare - Othello, 1602; long before chattel slavery.

### Superagency
- The ability for whites to reconfigure and direct institutional power regardless of official institutional role.
- Social phenomenon of the "Karen" - not part of any social institution of power in any way. Call the police, say the right things without saying their race explicitly; the police show up.
- **Vigilantism by Proxy** - you don't like black people, but you don't want to carry it out yourself; you enact your vigilantism *by proxy*.
- Agency is the ability to act to pursue a particular effect. White priviledge or power removes constraints present in a 'normal' society when the intent is to harm black and indigenous people.
- School-to-Prison pipeline has not gotten better; the focus has been on racist testing, racist policies, etc. Explaining factor: superagency.
- People ignore institutional rules and policy, and they do what they want; impunity and lack of punishmnet.
- All you need is some personal animosity.
- Schools are more segregated now than they were in Jim Crow.
- Regardless of policy change, we generally see the same outcomes.
- Best wayt to explain this - policy doesn't have an impact on people's actions, because they are not being enforced.
- Right-wingers are pretty successful, political and otherwise. Reagan, Bush, etc. - assumption that people will have super-agency power.
- Trump is popular because people identify with his perspective on race, sex, etc.; waking people up to what they can say, do, and get away with it.
- A blind eye to enforcement and policy upholding.
- Must get to a point where superagency is abolished.
- Some of the biggest racists are the "Social Justice Warriors": they are given superagency *even as so-called supporters* of antiracism.
