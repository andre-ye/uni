## Lecture 2: More Intro via John Locke, J.S. Mill, Susan Stebbing

- What do words stand for? Locke: ideas; Mill: objects in the world; Stebbing: thinking about intentions, fuctions of language, etc.
- Relationship between meaning and reference. Narrowing things in: what is the relationship between (proper) names and descriptions?
  - What does it mean to have names for things which don't exist?
  - Demonstratives 'this' 'that' -- pure reference
- "opaque context" -- if names are just what they refer to, then you can just substitute them in all contexts, but it seems that you can't
- Kemp -- start with a simple model and build up from there, like in physics.
- Frege: predicates are ''unsaturated'' -- they have a place for things to go into; predicates take singular terms and give out truth values.
- Our answers give various models of language and its relation to the world
  - Indrect reference
  - Ordinary language
  - Direct reference
- Stebbing: ordinary proper names resemble descriptive phrases in some respectives and demonstrative symbols in other cases
- Locke -- what you have first is the representation of the thing and not the entire thing itself
- Mill often appeals to intentions
