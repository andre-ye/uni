## "Oppression", Marilyn Frye
For Thursday, 9/28.

- Feminism *fundamentally* claims that women are oppressed. But what is oppression?
- **Response**: being the oppressor is a form of oppression too.
  - Masculinity is impossible and psychologically damaging to aspire towards
- **Result**: oppression has basically become a meaningless term, equivalent to limitation or suffering.
- **Reality: humans can be miserable without being oppressed.**

I
- **Etymology**: root of 'ooppression' is 'press' -- molding, flattening, reducing, caught between forces.
- **The double bind**: one must become invisible, one must participate in your own erasure. e.g.: Madonna/Whore complex
  - Important: systematically related pressures
  - *Objection!* There are groups which are made invisible... but also groups which are necessarily made visible, e.g. Jews and queers in Nazi Germany who had to wear identifying armbands. 
- Oppressed people are confined by forces **which are not avoidable, but systematically related** and which lock individuals in every direction. A cage is formed of many wires -- you can't just look at one.
  - *Objection!* If you adopt a broadly materialist view of social relations, then isn't all misery fundamentally oppression? What kind of metaphysical account are we adopting here? What is our principle of causality?
- **One must take a systemic view of oppression,** rather than focusing on individual actions.
  - Example: opening doors open for women. It's kind of ridiculous, because there's no purpose to it -- helpfulness is false. These little gestures mask the lack of more substantive help elsewhere.
  - Gestures are symbolic and part of a symbolic web, and the message is that women are incapable
  - An element of mockery / irony / performativity
  - You must recognize when you are thinking microscopically

III
- The human condition is that we all suffer frustraiton and limitation
- We are all limited within the social structure
- Surely in this case, everyone is oppressed. But it is not so.
- One must look in context to determine if there is an element of an oppressive structure -- are there forces which tend towards immobilization or reduction?
  - *Objection!* This is such a particular ontological view of freedom.
- Not everything which frustrates of limits a person is oppressive, and not every harm contributes to oppression.
  - Example: Chivas Regal rich white playboy
  - *Question!* What does it mean to be part of an "oppressor" group? Can you ever get out of it?
- Oppression is **continued**
- Is oppression fundamentally **economic**? 
- *Objection!* The notion of oppression seems to become circular here, where oppression is defined as a systematic set of forces which are oppressive. What is the irreducible core of oppression? Continued harm?
- *Objection!* There's a clean divide between inside and out here which is problematic. Is there a Foucauldian dimension here too? We are all touched by power...
- *Objection!* We cannot be naive structuralists... if every appeal to the oppressive or non-oppressive character of the particular relies upon asserting the oppressive web of forces, but we never actually understand how the web of forces is oppressive in an inrreducible way, then we are just asserting the existence of oppression without ever understanding it.
  - e.g. what does "for the benefit of men generally" mean?
  - What is the irreducible core of oppression? Is it sustained suffering? Is it something like dignity or honor? Or autonomy? We cannot be circular about it.
  - If it's something like dignity... well then there's a possible case to be made that men are indeed suffering real problems. Masculinity is not an easy thing to aspire to. Young men commit suicide over it.
- *Question!* Is oppression the continued exercise of power over autonomy? "immobilization"... or is it something different?
- *Question!* Is Sheryl Sandberg oppressed?
- *Question!* Is there a kind of biological essentialism here? Social essentialism?

IV
- Interesting take -- masculinity feels good to be affirmed, but to affirm masculinity one must negate vulnerability
- With women, there is understanding; with men, there is judgement -- so the social norms go, anyway.
- Womens' and mens' restraints are both structurally oppressive to women

V
- One is oppressed when one is a member of a group or a category -- the category here is "woman"
- A woman has little economic or political factor because she is a woman. *Question!* Is the significance of her oppression that she is a woman?
- Simply being a man is not what stands between now and a better now.
- **Women are oppressed as women**, but **men are not oppressed as men**

## "Locating Feminisms/Feminists", Obioma Nnaemeka (2001)
For Thursday, 9/28

- Igboland: a masquerade dance is full of complexity and paradox
- The history of feminist engagement is a sort of encounter between Igbo and masquerade
- Feminist practice is a pioneer of the diversity business -- feminist practice had tried to be diverse and multicultural (but failed)
- "Sisterhood"
- What is *African feminism*? What is the role of race in feminist discourse?
- Feminist *imperialism*? *Arrogance*? -- a simplifying of the global complexity
- African women call themselves African; but they are called black in America and Europe. Geography and color?
- Neofeminism for African feminism: from a philosophy of give-and-take and negotiation
  - Also: no-ego feminism
- A question of agency, subjectivity, and power, including the power of self-identification.

## Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics, Kimberle Crenshaw (1989)

- "All the Women Are White, All the Blacks Are Men, But Some of Us are Brave"
- Problematic idea: treat race and gender as mutually exclusive categories of experience. Antidiscrimination law uses a single-axis framework.
- Black women are erased in theory
- Subordination is conceptualized as a vector along an axis of privilege
- Race discrimination: focus is on wealthy Black men; sex discrimination: focus is on wealthy White women.
- Is discrimination against Black women sex discrimination?
- Supposed contradiction arises from the assumption that claims of exclusion are unidirectional.
- Traffic intersection: traffic flows both ways.
- Black women experience discrimination both similar to and different from white women and Black men.
- Categorical analyses limit expressivity.

The Significance of Doctrinal Treatment of Intersectionality

- Common political and theoretical approach to discrimination which operates to marginalize Black women
- Courts *and* feminist / civil rights thinkers. Black women are denied situation and centrality of their experiences. They are too much like women, too much like Blacks. 
- This isn't just a lack of political will. It's a fundamental theoretical failing when thinking about discrimination.

Fundamental question: What is the ontological category of race and gender? Is the focus unit a social group or is it the individual? And what does this mean epistemically, politically, ethically?
What are the ontological commitments brought by discrimination?

- How can you combine categories? How can you disentangle categories? Does intersectionality break with an "algorithmic" way of viewing discrimination, disparity?
- Race and sex become significant only when they explicti disadvantage victims
- Antidiscrimination law is not grounded in a bottom-up commitment to improve substantive conditions. It rather only regulates the extent to which certain protected features discriminate the determinations of outcomes
- *Question!* What is the role of analogy in explaining this sort of stuff? Is it false, sneaky? Or does it change something?
- "but for" analysis -- it doesn't consider other structural factors.
- But is there something beyond the rational empiricst principle here? There is some sort of parallel to the prisoner's dillemma here.
- Both feminist theory and antiracist politics end up being Black middle class or Black men
- Black women become marginalized. Or even -- "wired in" by the birdcage.'
