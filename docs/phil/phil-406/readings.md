## "Oppression", Marilyn Frye
For Thursday, 9/28.

- Feminism *fundamentally* claims that women are oppressed. But what is oppression?
- **Response**: being the oppressor is a form of oppression too.
  - Masculinity is impossible and psychologically damaging to aspire towards
- **Result**: oppression has basically become a meaningless term, equivalent to limitation or suffering.
- **Reality: humans can be miserable without being oppressed.**

I
- **Etymology**: root of 'ooppression' is 'press' -- molding, flattening, reducing, caught between forces.
- **The double bind**: one must become invisible, one must participate in your own erasure. e.g.: Madonna/Whore complex
  - Important: systematically related pressures
  - *Objection!* There are groups which are made invisible... but also groups which are necessarily made visible, e.g. Jews and queers in Nazi Germany who had to wear identifying armbands. 
- Oppressed people are confined by forces **which are not avoidable, but systematically related** and which lock individuals in every direction. A cage is formed of many wires -- you can't just look at one.
  - *Objection!* If you adopt a broadly materialist view of social relations, then isn't all misery fundamentally oppression? What kind of metaphysical account are we adopting here? What is our principle of causality?
- **One must take a systemic view of oppression,** rather than focusing on individual actions.
  - Example: opening doors open for women. It's kind of ridiculous, because there's no purpose to it -- helpfulness is false. These little gestures mask the lack of more substantive help elsewhere.
  - Gestures are symbolic and part of a symbolic web, and the message is that women are incapable
  - An element of mockery / irony / performativity
  - You must recognize when you are thinking microscopically

III
- The human condition is that we all suffer frustraiton and limitation
- We are all limited within the social structure
- Surely in this case, everyone is oppressed. But it is not so.
- One must look in context to determine if there is an element of an oppressive structure -- are there forces which tend towards immobilization or reduction?
  - *Objection!* This is such a particular ontological view of freedom.
- Not everything which frustrates of limits a person is oppressive, and not every harm contributes to oppression.
  - Example: Chivas Regal rich white playboy
  - *Question!* What does it mean to be part of an "oppressor" group? Can you ever get out of it?
- Oppression is **continued**
- Is oppression fundamentally **economic**? 
- *Objection!* The notion of oppression seems to become circular here, where oppression is defined as a systematic set of forces which are oppressive. What is the irreducible core of oppression? Continued harm?
- *Objection!* There's a clean divide between inside and out here which is problematic. Is there a Foucauldian dimension here too? We are all touched by power...
- *Objection!* We cannot be naive structuralists... if every appeal to the oppressive or non-oppressive character of the particular relies upon asserting the oppressive web of forces, but we never actually understand how the web of forces is oppressive in an inrreducible way, then we are just asserting the existence of oppression without ever understanding it.
  - e.g. what does "for the benefit of men generally" mean?
  - What is the irreducible core of oppression? Is it sustained suffering? Is it something like dignity or honor? Or autonomy? We cannot be circular about it.
  - If it's something like dignity... well then there's a possible case to be made that men are indeed suffering real problems. Masculinity is not an easy thing to aspire to. Young men commit suicide over it.
- *Question!* Is oppression the continued exercise of power over autonomy? "immobilization"... or is it something different?
- *Question!* Is Sheryl Sandberg oppressed?
- *Question!* Is there a kind of biological essentialism here? Social essentialism?

IV
- Interesting take -- masculinity feels good to be affirmed, but to affirm masculinity one must negate vulnerability
- With women, there is understanding; with men, there is judgement -- so the social norms go, anyway.
- Womens' and mens' restraints are both structurally oppressive to women

V
- One is oppressed when one is a member of a group or a category -- the category here is "woman"
- A woman has little economic or political factor because she is a woman. *Question!* Is the significance of her oppression that she is a woman?
- Simply being a man is not what stands between now and a better now.
- **Women are oppressed as women**, but **men are not oppressed as men**

## "Locating Feminisms/Feminists", Obioma Nnaemeka (2001)
For Thursday, 9/28

- Igboland: a masquerade dance is full of complexity and paradox
- The history of feminist engagement is a sort of encounter between Igbo and masquerade
- Feminist practice is a pioneer of the diversity business -- feminist practice had tried to be diverse and multicultural (but failed)
- "Sisterhood"
- What is *African feminism*? What is the role of race in feminist discourse?
- Feminist *imperialism*? *Arrogance*? -- a simplifying of the global complexity
- African women call themselves African; but they are called black in America and Europe. Geography and color?
- Neofeminism for African feminism: from a philosophy of give-and-take and negotiation
  - Also: no-ego feminism
- A question of agency, subjectivity, and power, including the power of self-identification.

## Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics, Kimberle Crenshaw (1989)

- "All the Women Are White, All the Blacks Are Men, But Some of Us are Brave"
- Problematic idea: treat race and gender as mutually exclusive categories of experience. Antidiscrimination law uses a single-axis framework.
- Black women are erased in theory
- Subordination is conceptualized as a vector along an axis of privilege
- Race discrimination: focus is on wealthy Black men; sex discrimination: focus is on wealthy White women.
- Is discrimination against Black women sex discrimination?
- Supposed contradiction arises from the assumption that claims of exclusion are unidirectional.
- Traffic intersection: traffic flows both ways.
- Black women experience discrimination both similar to and different from white women and Black men.
- Categorical analyses limit expressivity.

The Significance of Doctrinal Treatment of Intersectionality

- Common political and theoretical approach to discrimination which operates to marginalize Black women
- Courts *and* feminist / civil rights thinkers. Black women are denied situation and centrality of their experiences. They are too much like women, too much like Blacks. 
- This isn't just a lack of political will. It's a fundamental theoretical failing when thinking about discrimination.

Fundamental question: What is the ontological category of race and gender? Is the focus unit a social group or is it the individual? And what does this mean epistemically, politically, ethically?
What are the ontological commitments brought by discrimination?

- How can you combine categories? How can you disentangle categories? Does intersectionality break with an "algorithmic" way of viewing discrimination, disparity?
- Race and sex become significant only when they explicti disadvantage victims
- Antidiscrimination law is not grounded in a bottom-up commitment to improve substantive conditions. It rather only regulates the extent to which certain protected features discriminate the determinations of outcomes
- *Question!* What is the role of analogy in explaining this sort of stuff? Is it false, sneaky? Or does it change something?
- "but for" analysis -- it doesn't consider other structural factors.
- But is there something beyond the rational empiricst principle here? There is some sort of parallel to the prisoner's dillemma here.
- Both feminist theory and antiracist politics end up being Black middle class or Black men
- Black women become marginalized. Or even -- "wired in" by the birdcage.'

## The Invention of "the Male Gaze", Lauren Michele Jackson, 2023

- The male gaze: British film theorist Laura Mulvey, 1973 "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema"
- The male gaze "projects its fantasy onto the female figrue, which is styled accordingly"
- What are the mechanics of looking? Need the tools of psychoanalysis, especially of Jacques Lacan.
- The Lacanian mirror stage: an infant achieves self-mastery by understnading their own reflection. Something similar happens wiht identification with onscreen characters.
- Freud: infantile sexuality has a voyeuristic pleasure. 
- Mulvey: cinema reconciles the tension between the Lacanian mirror stage (self-understanding) and Freudian voyeruism (objectification of that outside
- Our gaze is in sympathy with the camera's interests, posed for our viewing.
- Cinematic images reproduce gender as patriarchy sees it.
- The cameras "teach us how to look".
- A central figrue now of feminist film criticism, an intellectual landmark.
- Even the oppressor's viewpoint can be s tie of uncertainty (Fanon, *Black Skin, White Masks*)
- bell hooks, oppositional gaze -- not developed merely by being Black and female, but rather cultivated by resisting dominant ways of looking.

## "Feminism in 'Waves': Useful Metaphor or Not?", Linda Nicholson (2010)

- What is the current state of US feminism? 
- In the 1960s, it was very useful for feminists to describe their movement as the "second wave", because it reminded people of the historical past and connections -- a long tradition of activism.
- **The wave metaphor has outlived its usefulness.** But it can also be a historical and political blockage. 
- It suggests that there is one phenomenon, "feminism", which unites gender activism across the history of the United States. 
- But this is reductive and serves an obfuscatory purpose. 
- "The first wave" of suffragism may not even be convincingly called feminism.
- Women were taking on and living a greater sense of equality of men only in the conditions brought about in the 20th century.
- The hope is that gender activism has not died but ratehr just become more jazzy in its form.
- Following the mass movements of the 1960s-80s, feminism began institutionalizing itself.
- The gaps between men and women still continue to exist: rigid beauty standards, a sexual double standard, the wage gap, etc.
- The post-WWII material movements of women into new jobs led towards generation of wide adoption (whereas it could not in the 1920s).
- But liberal feminism is only one part of he feminist movement of the 60s-80s. Radical feminism
- ... but radical feminism could also only have advanced a small group of privileged women. It became alienating
- Marxist and socialist feminism: did not resonate with much of the US population either
- Feminism has achieved what it has achieved through resonance with the materially experienced needs of the 'many' / people.
- We are not in a 'third wave' currently.
- Rather, there is a kaleidoscope -- the ocean's ebbs and swells

## "Epistemologies of Ignorance", Shannon Sullivan and Nancy Tuana (2007)

- Ignorance is of increasing concern, propped up as an alternative to elitism
- It is "willfull ignorance"
- Ignorance poses special epistemological questions.
- Explaining ignorance is not new. But explaining ignornace as a substantive epistemic practice in itself is new.
- Willfull ignorance attempts to explain and account for substatnive practices of ignorance as *structural*
- Ignorance is a problem relating to ontologies of truth.
- **Three arguments**
  1. Ignorance follows from the fact of our *situatedness as knowers*
  2. Ignornace is related to specific aspects of group identities
  3. Structural analysis of the ways in which oppressive systems produce ignorance

I
- Lorraine Code: "S knows that p" epistemologies assume all S's are interchangeable
- Knowers are nonfungible
- We need to develop a geography of the epistemic terrain -- understand the sociopolitical structures which produce subjective positions and identities
- This does not mean relativism
- Epistemic advantages and disadvantages are not the same for all
- Most knowledge is the product of judgement rather than deductive argument
- An adequate concept of epistemic situatedness requires understanding the knower's geneology.
- An epistemic situation may be advantaged/disadvantaged depending on what kind of knowledge we are pursuing / i.e. exist in relation to specific kinds of inquiry.

II
- Epistemic ignorance, not general, but rather focused on specific groups of knowers who share a *social* location
- Specific features of women's epistemic situation gives them an epistemic advantages; we can arrive at more empirically adequate descriptions when starting research from women's lives.
- **Women are usually alienated from social power but rarely alienated from the everyday needs of maintaining material existence.**
- These analyses should be applied selectively, and locally
- Harding: "members of oppressed groups have fewer interests in ignorance about the social order and fewer reasons to invest in maintaining or justifying the status quo than do dominant groups"
  - Yet in fact they might, for purposes of living within a system which suppresses anti-ignorance.
  - Peoples' acceptance of various critical social theories are often a (complex) function of their social identy
- Maybe good epistemic practices / virtues can overcome epistemic limitations 
- Belief formulation requires judgment calls about relevance, plausibility, coherence, etc. -- and these are all already working within me.
- Group identity makes an epistemically relevant difference, because it influences the transcendental a priori beliefs.
- WHy is it important to have women on the Supreme Court or in law-making bodies? Only women are in a position to see the full weight of the significance of the law's effect on women.
- Aspects of group identity:
  1. All knowers are situated, and this has epistemic implications for judgement
  2. Situations are correlated in at least some important ways to social identity, without making essentializing claims
  3. Female gender identity includes a general marginality from social power and a lack of alienation from materiality
  4. A female-gendered location is a resource to build a feminist standpoint
  5. Male-identity is epistemically disadvantaged in dominant gender-related social power, less interest in questioning them, even.
- G.I. Bill and the process of democratizing the US academy, the production of academic knowledge. 
- Epistemic ignorance is contextual

III
- Epistemic ignornace provides a more structural account of the nature of oppressive systems.
- A structural argument focuses on generally differentiated experiences and interests
- Ignornace is not a lack, but rather a substantive epistemic practice which differentiates the social group
- As a member of a dominant social group, one may inculcate patterns of belief-forming practices which create certain effects on systematic ignorance.
- The Racial Contract prescribes an "inverted epistemology" / "epistemology of ignorance", cognitive dysfunction -- whites are unable to understand the world they've made
- Racism is a *type of subjectivity* which forms patterns of perceptual attention that distort reality. (What is reality?)
- Whiteness as a political construct includes a cognitive model and ensures a consensual halluciantion / racial fantasy. So there is a cognitive / moral economic *psychically* required

IV
- Frankfurt School's critique of instrumental rationality. Project: a materialist critical analysis of reason under capitalism and fascism
- Made links betwween kinds of knowing practices and political economy structures
- Disagreement between Habermas and Marcuse + Horkheimer. Habermas: instruemntal rationality was a legitimate epistemic practice as long as it was not universalized hegemonically.
- Horkheimer: argued against naive empiricism. Both the subject and the objective are historical. Critical theorists must denaturalize the product and process of knowledge. 
- Traditional theory vs critical theory: uniting epistemic and political factors
- Instrumentalized reason is not an aid in truth, but works to obscure it. 
- When we describe the world around us, we are not merely reporting on natural creations, but products of collective human praxes.
- Traditional theory's focus on problem solving is congruent with capitalist rationality. This aims at prediction and quantification.
- Explanation, hermeneutic interpretation, and normative argument are denigrated as useless speculations.
- Universities might be places of sitting, meditation, and knowledge absorption. (Socratic orgasm.)
- The result of social production of the knowing individual is a liquidation of the subject
- The reduction of reason to analysis 
- White ignornace may be a type of loss of critical rationality: a process of self-preservation without the self
- Little attention is paid in the philosophy of science to the structural economic organization of this society
- Traditional epistemology cannot handle this level of reflexivity. Yet sociological concerns are central to any epistemnic assessment of knowledge.
- Critical theory: bring consciousness to the link between the social production of knowledge and of society.
- Horkheimer criticizes the use of pragmatic criteria and defends a notion of objective reason. Objective reason critiques subjective reason
- We must not put science in service of subjective ends.
- Reason must be restricted to preempt the objective truths it reveals, and ignorance is the result.

V
- Horkheimer's critiques can help us understand the way in which knowers are situated, structured, differentiated
- Said: Orientalism naturalizes its object of study as discrete, stable, fixed
- Epistemology must be reflexively aware and critical of its location within an econoimc system
