<!-- ## Week 1 Thursday: Syllabus and Introduction to Feminisms -->

## Week 2 Tuesday: African Feminism and Intersectionality
- How to recognize wihthout marginalizing the people who are oppressed according to gender.
- Ripples / waves of feminism
- Assimilation / an anti-universality becoming a new universality -- is the chameleon a metaphysically problematic ('new universal') being?
- What is the metaphysical / ontological nature of the metaphor and the subject? Are they instantiations of the same Platonic form?
- Crenshaw reading

## Week 2 Thursday:
- Evolutionary biology -- mammals, primates, linking concepts of sex / sexual dynamics in biology with human gender
- What is Crenshaw trying to emphasize?
- General problem with the single-axis: it captures important elements of discrimination, but it is not sufficient
- Multiple axis: sex + gender + race + ...
- At a unique position: black women are uniquely discriminated against. It's not about simply adding identities, but about unique intersections which are more than the sum of their parts. 
- Testimony on womens' pain is often not taken seriously, especially Black womens' pain

Discrimination along A:

|     | A' | A'' |
| --- | --- | --- |
| B'  |  X  |     |
| B'' |  X  |     |

Discrimination along B:

|     | A' | A'' |
| --- | --- | --- |
| B'  |  X  |  X   |
| B'' |    |     |

Discrimination against A or B:

|     | A' | A'' |
| --- | --- | --- |
| B'  |  X  |  X  |
| B'' |  X  |     |

Discrimination uniquely at A and B:

|     | A' | A'' |
| --- | --- | --- |
| B'  |  X  |     |
| B'' |   |     |


Waves of feminism
- 'First movement': 1848 - 1920, suffrage
- The idea of 'waves' coined during the 'second wave'
- Focus of the 'third wave', 1991 - now: intersectionality

## Week 3 Tuesday: Feminist Epistemology and Philosophy of Science
- Knowledge and ignorance from the perspective of feminism.
- Two questions for Haraway
  - The metaphor of vision: what is the metaphor of vision doing in the text?
  - What is the problem of objectivity for feminism / feminist epistemology and philosophy of science? 
- Surveillance and the male gaze, a perversion / false standing for universality
- The view from nowhere, which transcends location, particularity, identity. 
- You will always have views from somewhere, based on embodiment.
- Problem of objectivity: how can you have objective, *situated* knowledge?
- Alcoff, epistemologies of ignorance
  - Lorraine Code, epistemic knowers are not constant. Situated knowledge.
  - Sandra Harding, group identities influence what knowledge you have and your ignorance.
  - Charles Mills,
  - Also, Horkheimer
- Ignorance epistemology is always associated with a "rational" system of judgement
- Our very conception of truth can be itself ignorant, in Horkheimer's case, failing to be sociologically reflexive, that is, accounting for its conditions of (re)production. 
- Yet the notion of critical reason is still very dubious... and possibly reproduces instrumental reason's logic.

## Week 4 Tuesday: Intersectional Feminism
- Concern: "my feminism will be intersectional" has become a tired cliche
- Whose intersection(s)?
- Transnational feminism: race and colonization
- Are you committed to decolonizing if you are committed to intersectional feminism?
- Intersectionality not about individuals but about social axes / dimensions
- Friendship? Care? *Friendship throughotu colonialism*? Is there a burden/strain of friendship?
- Is friendship reciprocal?
- "Affectively saturated" story -- the main feeling about the stories we tell of intersectionality is of black feminism vs. the critic, the affect of defensiveness
- Does Nash end up reproducing what she criticizes?
- Political libido
- the role of affect in feminist theory, what it means to theorize
- Nash: Black feminists have adopted a vision of intersectionality which is not true to Black feminism
  - Black feminism should not follow a capitalist logic of property accumulation ('this is mine, this is my territory, this is my land') -- think about and be more critical about the concerns around 'appropriation', etc.

## Week 4 Thursday: Transnational Feminism

- Is transnational feminism about intersectionality? 
- Decolonization vs intersectionality
- Post-feminism: the idea that feminism is no longer necessary, that we have achieved equality
- Post-colonialism: understanding the world after colonialism, after the end of colonialism. Imperialism after imperialism.
- Settler colonialism.

What is ideal theory?
- Full compliance (people tend to agree and enact justice) vs partial compliance
- Utopian vs realistic (how many factual constraints are there)
- End-state vs transitional
- Ideal vs non-ideal
- John Rawls, Theory of Justice
- Khader -- arguing against using ideal theory to critique non-Western culture
- Ideal theory needs to be thin as opposed to thick

## Week 5 Tuesday -- "Genetic Racial Naturalism"
- Old school racial naturalists, population racial naturalists, genetic racial naturalists
- Walter Benn Michaels: you have to have essentialism to have an objective account of race
- Everyone wants to take down the social constructionists. First take-down: it's either subjective or relativistic
- Charles Mills: but no -- there are two steps to these things. Once we develop a criteria, there is objectivity / an objective set of conditions.
