<!-- ## Week 1 Thursday: Syllabus and Introduction to Feminisms -->

## Week 2 Tuesday: African Feminism and Intersectionality
- How to recognize wihthout marginalizing the people who are oppressed according to gender.
- Ripples / waves of feminism
- Assimilation / an anti-universality becoming a new universality -- is the chameleon a metaphysically problematic ('new universal') being?
- What is the metaphysical / ontological nature of the metaphor and the subject? Are they instantiations of the same Platonic form?
- Crenshaw reading

## Week 2 Thursday:
- Evolutionary biology -- mammals, primates, linking concepts of sex / sexual dynamics in biology with human gender
- What is Crenshaw trying to emphasize?
- General problem with the single-axis: it captures important elements of discrimination, but it is not sufficient
- Multiple axis: sex + gender + race + ...
- At a unique position: black women are uniquely discriminated against. It's not about simply adding identities, but about unique intersections which are more than the sum of their parts. 
- Testimony on womens' pain is often not taken seriously, especially Black womens' pain

## Week 3 Tuesday: Feminist Epistemology and Philosophy of Science
- Knowledge and ignorance from the perspective of feminism.
- Two questions for Haraway
  - The metaphor of vision: what is the metaphor of vision doing in the text?
  - What is the problem of objectivity for feminism / feminist epistemology and philosophy of science? 
- Surveillance and the male gaze, a perversion / false standing for universality
- The view from nowhere, which transcends location, particularity, identity. 
- You will always have views from somewhere, based on embodiment.
- Problem of objectivity: how can you have objective, *situated* knowledge?
- Alcoff, epistemologies of ignorance
  - Lorraine Code, epistemic knowers are not constant. Situated knowledge.
  - Sandra Harding, group identities influence what knowledge you have and your ignorance.
  - Charles Mills,
  - Also, Horkheimer
- Ignorance epistemology is always associated with a "rational" system of judgement
- Our very conception of truth can be itself ignorant, in Horkheimer's case, failing to be sociologically reflexive, that is, accounting for its conditions of (re)production. 
- Yet the notion of critical reason is still very dubious... and possibly reproduces instrumental reason's logic.
