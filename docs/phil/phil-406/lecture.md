<!-- ## Week 1 Thursday: Syllabus and Introduction to Feminisms -->

## Week 2 Tuesday: African Feminism and Intersectionality
- How to recognize wihthout marginalizing the people who are oppressed according to gender.
- Ripples / waves of feminism
- Assimilation / an anti-universality becoming a new universality -- is the chameleon a metaphysically problematic ('new universal') being?
- What is the metaphysical / ontological nature of the metaphor and the subject? Are they instantiations of the same Platonic form?
- Crenshaw reading

## Week 2 Thursday:
- Evolutionary biology -- mammals, primates, linking concepts of sex / sexual dynamics in biology with human gender
- What is Crenshaw trying to emphasize?
- General problem with the single-axis: it captures important elements of discrimination, but it is not sufficient
- Multiple axis: sex + gender + race + ...
- At a unique position: black women are uniquely discriminated against. It's not about simply adding identities, but about unique intersections which are more than the sum of their parts. 
- Testimony on womens' pain is often not taken seriously, especially Black womens' pain
