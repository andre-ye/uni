## Lecture 1: A New Division of the World
- Race is a fairly modern conception -- the earliest you're going to find it is in the 16th century
- Orbis Terrarum (isidorian map) -- one of the ways in which people divided up the entire world
- Religion is the basis for the division of the world
  - Noah's Arc: Noah's sons, Shem (East), Ham (Africa), and Japheth (West).
  - Cursed be Canaan, a servant of servants shall he be unto his bretheren. Not only is Ham the servant, but also his son Canaan -- introduction of a reproductive principle
- Orientalism
  - You don't need race to hate Muslims, e.g.
  - "Orient" / "Occident" comes from "oriens" (the rising, e.g. the East) and "occidens" (the setting, e.g. the West)
  - the 'near est', 'middle east', 'far easit' -- orient, not occident
- Spread of Islam -- a movmeent to take back Holy Lands
- Crusades -- a movement to take back Holy Lands
  - But first you do i s==s join the crusades.
  - Reconquistra -- driving the argument that you need t =o be Japanese or O+Korean
  -  Moriscos / marramonocs
  - 
- "New Christians" have secod-class students.
- Christian lurity: less about affirming bloodlinea n dmore about irming one images' bloodliees are (pi0-3)
- Slavery without rce -- historically, slavery was a common practice. e.g. across languages
- Rise of feudalism in North and central Europea
- La Reconquista -- a system in the Iberian Peninsula
  - La Encomienda -- to entrust, a system used byt he PSniah to control and idstribute labor
  - A way of motivating people to fight. 
  - los adelantados 
  - people on conquered territory become subjects of the Spanish monarchy
  - Is it slavery? Sort of
  - If you convert, then... you can't enslave
  - 15% of the profits that Christopher Columbus made from the voyage, he got to keep. Columbus wanted to make indigenous people slaves.
- Justifying the conquest -- who has dominion over these lands?
  - Satan was running amuck in America: convert?
- Treaty of Tordesillas (1494) -- a line drawn down the Atlantic Ocean, dividing the world between Spain and Portugal
  - Portugal got Brazil
  - Spain got the rest of the Americas
  - Portugal got Africa -- Portugal become the slavers -- the first slaves to the Americas come through Portuguese slavers
- Spain and human rights -- you can trace a lot of human rights to these times
  - Laws of Burgos, 1512
  - Spanish Requirimiento, tell Natives to submit to Spanish rule or be at war
  - Sublimis Deus, 1537 -- declared indigenous Americans rational
  - Native Americans New Laws, 1542
- The idea -- these are humans. if you want to exploit their labor, how do you do so?
- Valladolid Debates, 1550-1551. Promoted by the king of Spain, Carlos V. Pitted Gines de Sepulveda vs. Bartolome de las Casas.
  - Sepulveda: the official historian and theologian of the Spanish Crown. You have two weapons: the Bible and Aristotle. Colonialism is a civilizing task emancipating those living in barbarity. Virtue, humanity, and true religion is more valuable than gold and silver.
  - Aristotle: the telos of Native Americans is to be slaves
  - Ingenuity does not prove equality to the Spanishing
  - Worship of false idols, cannibalism, sacrifice of the innocent, sins against the divine.
  - Bartolome de las Casas. Emigrated to Hispaniola in 1502. Gives up his land, etc. Initially: you can't just force someone to convert, you need to save their soul. Cannot be brutal.
  - Argued for a misread of Aristotle and Aquinas. Four ways of being a barbarian
    - Exhibiting cruel and irrational behavior
    - Lacking a written language
    - Having no understanding of justice or civilization
    - Not being Christian
  - "Barbarian" -- from undeveloped language, "bar bar bar"
  - Still talking about religion -- need to take Jesus Christ
  - Is De Las Casas' defense anti-racist? We probably still don't have a concept of race yet
  - De Las Casas: the Indians are too weak to be slaves, but some people thrive -- the children of Ham.
- Decartes' undergraduate logic textbook written in the Americas
- La Casta -- hierarchical system of caste systems and classifications which is starting to look a lot like race. Proto-Lamarkian ideas about race, you might have good stock, but if you're not born in the right soil, you're not going to be as good.
  - Peninsular -- born on Iberian Peninsula, parents are white and European
  - Creoles -- born in America, parents are white and European
  - Mestizos -- European and Native American
  - Mulattoes -- European and African descent
  - Africans -- free and enslaved
  - Native Americans -- Indians, Aztec, Maya, inca, etc.
- They don't have Darwinian evolution or Lamarck yet, merely sympethetic -- somehow it tends to pass off into your offspring. 
- Racial science, and moves away a little bit from religion and towards other proto-scientific things
- Certain castes get denied certain things.
- The Black Legend
  - Due to politics, religious tensions, and to a little jealousy, European powers begin a propaganda campaign against Spain and Catholicism
  - Spaniards who came to the New Wordl were greedy conquistadors, but the English who came are peaceful colonists seeking liberty.
- Immanuel Kant -- brutal writing on the Spaniard. There is a non-European taste
- Race in the United States
  - First group of African slaves come to Jamestwon in 1619
  - Most laborers in the US were indentured servants
  - initially, Africans were treated as indentured servants.
  - The Portguese initially baptized the slaves, so they need to be indentured servants; when they filled out their contract, they were done
  - Slow transformation into race-based chattel slavery, motivated by three factors
    - Demand for labor on the colonies exceeds the supply of indentured servants coming from Europe
    - Life for an indentured servant sucks, many of them run away, easy fro white indentured servants to blend in as free men
    - Revolt, people keep on revolting -- Bacon's Rebellion, 1676. Burned down Jamestown, Virginia, a large number of people from different classes.
    - 1705 Virginia Slave Codes -- a lot of thought put into the slave codes. how do you stop thes efrom happening?
  - Virginia Slave Codes of 1705
    1. Established new property rights for slave owners -- humans as property
    2. Legal and free trading of slaves
    3. Prohibited Blacks, regardless of free status, from owning weapons
    4. Prohibited Whites from being employed by Blacks
    5. ...
  - This is where the divison between White and Black emerges here.
  - How to distinguish free from bonded labor? How to prevent lower classes from revolting? Slaves from Africa provide the perfect solution. Any Black woman's child is a slave. Your father could be a rapist. Endless supply of labor, no need to import, and you have skin color as a marker of slavery. Also a psychological reason fro poor whites to buy in.
  - Thomas Jefferson, 1743-1826. 
    - Monogenesis: humans have one origin. Christian worldview.
    - Polygenesis: the human species have multiple origins.
    - If races are supposed to be distinct, then where did they come from? Does the existence of race undermine genesis? Kant is the hero, because he gives a monogenesis account which explains multiple races.
    - Seeing the divisions -- but what are the geneses? Jefferson -- "seeds"

## Lecture 2: American Whiteness

The Rise of "Race"
- Basic elements of race which need to all come together
- Religion: religious conflicts, religious myths on the origin and purpose of humanity, cutting up the world
- Slavery (chattel): you need exploitable labor that is marked an dunlikely to win a revolt.
- Settler colonialism -- not just any kind of colonialism. Need to justify the occupation of what was formerly foreign land.
- Xenophobia -- a strong sense of nationalism, a strong sense of "us" and "them"

Colonialism
- A system in which an outside group takes control over foreign land and controls its resources and often its peoplpe
- Most forms of colonialism become exploitative: a metropole seeks to derive profits by exploiting the colony.
- Often a doctrine of "terra nullius", or folks are not using their resources well.
- Post-colonianlism: rebuilding projects by independent states that at one point were colonies.
- Maybe post-colonial never led to de-colonial. Is there still a logic of resource extraction from one part of the world to another?
- Settler colonialism is not just / for the metropole's profit, but to establish permanent settlement in a territory.
- Settler colonialism is a structure rather than an event. It is achieved through treaties.
- Terra nullius -- the land was empty

Religious Differences: Latin vs. Anglo Europe
- Anglo Europe: between Protestants and Catholics.
- Latin Europe is more concerned with the division between Christians and Muslims.

Colonization of the America
- Latin colonists came with particular objectives. Mainly single men coming to make money.
- Some people explicit aim to spread the goslpel of Christianity.

- Lation-MAerican patriotism. MUlti-axis paradigm of race
- In Anglo-American racism, you have the notion of hypodescent, one-drop rule

The Ancients
- Carving nature, Plato, 427-347 BCE. Nature has divisions. There are natural places to carve up things.
- Aristotle, 842-322 BCE. THat which a thing has in common with toher like things without which it would not be that thing: essence. 

The Moderns
- Bernier, 1620-1688. Four or five species who diffeences are solarge that they serve a diviosn of the earth. 
- Color is only an accident upon them
- These are all white people -- you can yet carve nature at its joints.
- Tribalism, religiosity, etc. artificially divide you -- but you are part of a larger group

Adam and Eve, A New Division of the Earth
- The Abrahamic tradition has subscribed to monogenesis.
- Isaac La Peyrere made a case for polygenesis in *men Before Adam8.
- Polygenesis: any belief ror theory that the human species had multiple origins.
- By mid-1750s, Europeans believe that there are racial differences
- Monogenesis (e.g. Montesqieu) -- differences result from climate, geopgrahy, and diet.
- Jean-Baptiste Lamarck: the theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics. Organisms pass onto their offspring physical characteristics that they have acquired during their lifetime. 
- Polygenesists: traits are unchaniging and perspesit over time, inferiroity is an original and esssential trait. 
- Immaneul Kant, 1724 - 1804
  - One of the frist anthropologsts
  - A racist (?)
  - In his time, more well-known for his anthropology than his philosophy.
- Blumbenbach
  -  Blueman is a reacial egaliatiran, but htings that race is degenrate
  - Degeneration theory
  - All the beaitufl people came frmo the Cuacauses and you get to oht==
- Joseph Arhur de Gobineau, *An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races* (1853), maybe the most racist text for its time.
  - Developed the theory of the Aryan master race
  - "Aryan" taken from a Hindu legend, preserving superior Aryan racial heritage
  - Buddhism and Islam taken to be religions of decay.
- Francis Galton (1822 - 1911)
  - Introduced Eugenics
  - Darwinian eugenics which the Nazis use -- any improvements we make now are not going to pass on to their kids. Why educate dumb people? Their children will be dumb
  - Lamarckian eugenics takes hold in Latin America. You don't have to have a degenerate race. Improving people will pass on better genes tot he next generation. Latin America tries to whiten themselves.
    - You get health and education programs, etc. 
    - Lamarckian eugenics have horrible outcomes too
  - Regression towards mediocrity in hereditary stature.
  - Social programs helping the poor are dysgenic. 
- Madison Grant (1865, 1937)
  - *The Passing of the Great Race* (1916)
  - White folks have degenerate races as well
  - The Great Nordic race is kind of newer, so their genes are a little bit weaker. The Nordic people are also the most brave people. The swarthy Latin people are seducing the women: Mediterranean and "Iberian" subspecies, etc.
  - The United States is not a melting pot, it's a Nordic nation, and the Nordic race is going to pass away.
  - Quoted repeatedly in Congress while passing racist legislation
- 1700s Anti-German Zenophobia
  - Benjamin Franklin: they do not assimilate, they herd together and establish their languages to the exclusion of ours. 
  - "Why shuold Pennsylvania, founded by the English, become a colony of aliens?"

First US Citizenship / Immigration Laws
- The constitution didn't talk about immigration -- they can't get enough coming in
- Congress shall have the power to establish a uniform rule of naturalization
- 1790 Naturalization Act: free white persons of good character and living in the US for 2 years

Anti-Irish and Catholic Xenophobia in the 1800s
- White Anglo-Saxon Protestants (WAPS)
- WAPS came to see themselves as the "real" Americans
- Catholicism seen as inherently foreign and dangerous to "real" America
- Catholic church represented monarchy, etc.
- The "Irish-Iberian" thesis / hypothesis
- Know-nohthing party, "Americans must rule Americans"
- Repealing the naturalization act.
- Race is part of a nation-building process. But they still let them naturalize, which was not the case against black, inidgenous, asian peoples

American Whiteness
- Black and indigenous ameircans are ineligible for US citizenship
- In some cases, it is about being free. Dred Scott v. Sanford, 1857
- Elk v. Wilkins, 1884 -- indigenous man just wants to vote.
- It i sonly until 1924 that Indians are given citizenship
- Asian ineligibility for naturalized US citizenship
  - Chinese exclusion acts, 1875
  - Takao Ozawa v. US, 1922
- Asiatic barred zone -- not even residence in the United States allowed.
- George Shishim, born in the Ottoman Empire, moves to the US and becomes LAPD. Arrests the son of a prominent lawyer. Argument: Shishim should have never been a cop, he should not have been an American citizen, he is not 'white'
- Judge Hutton getting ready to rule in George Shishim v. United States (1909) that an "Arab" identity was non-white
- Shishim: "If I am a Mongolian, then so was Jesus, because we came from the same land." 
- Hutton rules Shishim white by law.
- Why is Middle Eastern included in Caucasian? -- the consistency is how close are you to Christianity. It starts to whiten you.
- Orient / Occident: Islam can darken you.
- Takao Ozawa. Lived in the United States for 20 years. Ozawa applies for US citizenship. US denies his application because he is of the Japanese race. Ozawa denies: American education, Christian churches, etc. -- rolls up his sleeve and puts his arm next to every judge and says that they are as white
- Is Takao white? No -- the appellant in this case is clearly of a race which is not *Caucasian*. 
- Race, as defined by biological anthropology, trumps ethnicity (culture and appearance) in determining eligibility for US citizenship.
- Bhagat Singh Thind -- fought for the US in World War I. Gave him citizenship, but then took it away -- he's not white. He hears the result of Takao Ozawa -- according tot he anthropology of the time and the fact he was from a high Indu caste, he was technically of the Caucasian race and could not be denied citizneship on grounds of not being white.
- Is "Caucasian" enough to determine a peron's whiteness? The court changes again -- not "Caucasian", but rather "white", not of scientific origin, of familiar observation and knowledge -- Hindus are readily distinguishable from "folk theory" white individuals

Race in Latin America
- Wars of independence led by Creoles -- Peninsulares taking their jobs.
- Officially end the caste system, but it continues socially: Blanqueamiento
- If we cna get more white people to have children and discourage darker skinned children to have children, the population will be whitened.
- Argentina's constitution, Article 25, does not allow closing immigrants from Europe. When the Nazis came over after the war, so many settled in Argentina.
- Race comes to be linked with phenotypes, especially skin color, and culture / class / social standing
- Siblings of the same parents can belong to different races under Blanqueamiento. It's not about heritage, it's metaphysically about skin color. 
- Jose Vasconcelos (1882 - 1959): there is a purpose / spirit that undergirds the rise and fall of civilizations and races. This spirit is like a current in a body of water. There is a conflict between two white races of Europe: Latins and the Anglos. The French / Spanish / Portuguese / Italian against the English and the US.
- Latin America is in a prime position to play a key role in "history's mandate" -- history seeks the fusion of peoples -- all of the races come together and produces the cosmic race
  - Asian, Black, White comes together
- In Mexico, there are many problems -- but it is a Mestizo nation. Look at the flags: an indigenous symbol and European colors.
- Madison Grant sees this and says this is the problem -- you can't have the melting pot. The absorption of blood of the conquistadors byt he "native Indian population" has produced the Mexican.

## Lecture 3: Race -- Real or not? Conserve of eliminate?

Different Schools of Thought on Race
- Race naturalism (realism, 'really real')
  - Races represent a natural (non-artificial, non-social) distinction within the human species
  - Racialism: a version of racial naturalism, which holds that these differences form an essential set of heritable, physical, moral, etc. characteristics
  - There can be race naturalism without racialism
  - Entailments: 
    - Standard rcism, keep the races separate, pure, in their place. Even eliminate the undesirable races.
    - Racial egalitarians: there are natural differences between races, but we should acknowledge them for relevant purposes; yet all persons deserve equal moral respect. 
- Racial skepticism (anti-realism)
  - Racial realism is false, because there are no biological races
- Social constructivism (realism)
  - Social constructivists are still realists
  - Races are not natural entities but come into existence through human actions or institutions.
  - Races are 'nominally' real -- nominalism, thinks are grouped together because of the ideas we have, but it's not arbitrary. The criteria might be arbitrary, but once you accept the criteria, it's not arbitrary.
- Racial pluralists
  - Races have many definitions, so many views of "race" can be true at the same time

| Metaphysics of race | Naturalists | Skeptics | Constructivists | Pluralists |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| "Race" -- natural category? | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |
| "Race" -- social category?  | No  | No | Yes | Yes |
| "Race" -- real?             | Yes | No | Yes | Yes |

Semantic / Normative Recommendations.  urd
- Eliminativists: there ar no ancient esse urdnces, so we ought to eliminate race language
- Conservationists: we need to preserve the lagnaugae of "race"
- Revisionists: race refers to essences which race talk.

Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889 - 1951)
- Linguistic turn in analytic philosophyy: "to show the fly by the way out of the fly-bottle"
- Atom: originally from the Greek *atomos*
- Eliminativist: let's get rid of phlogiston, let's get rid of race


| Semantics of race | Eliminativists | Conservationists | Revisionists |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Should we end talk of 'race'?      | Yes | No | No |
| Should we reform 'race' talk?      | No  | Yes | No |
| Did 'race' signify something real? | No  | No | Yes |
| Can 'race' signify something real? | No  | Yes | Yes |

W.E.B. du Bois, *The Conservation of the Races*
- Du Bois is responsding to Madison Grant, 1965-1937
- There is a spirit guiding the spirit of history towards a new race, Jose Vasconcelos, 1882-1959. Deep into Hegel. 
- The folks who are most racist have a sort of transcendental view.
- The worry is always that scientists will always find some feature of division -- even if there are such divisions, they are wrong, becuase we are moving towards a racial egalitarianism, where every race has some sort of contribution
- Aaron Pina Mora, "La Raza Cosmica" -- the superrace is still very white
- What is Du Bois' position on race?
  - Du Bois is clearly not a racial skeptic
  - It is not clear that Du Bois was a racial naturalist -- these (scientific) criteria of race are getting "exasperatingly" intermingled.
  - Du Bois sounds like a constructivist...
  - Race? A vast family of human beings, generally of common blood and language, always of common history, traditions and impulses... striving together, voluntarily and involuntarily, accomplishing vividly conceived ideals of life ...
  -  Du Bois has a transcendentalist view of race -- no mere physical differences -- transcending them
- Appiah: Du Bois never transcends his racial naturalism.

Anthony Appiah.
- What is important to philosophy is to get to the truth
- The consensus among biologists is that there are very few genetic differences among humans.
- Race does not exist

Ashley Montagu, *The Concept of Race* (1959)
- The idea of race is one of the most dangerous and tragic myths of our time
- Use the term 'ethnic' group, which applies better than 'race'. 
- An eliminativist
- The term 'ethnicity' doesn't really show up until the 1930s
- Post-melting pot language

Anthony Appiah, *Why There Are No Races*
- An ideational account of race -- either concepts are embedded in our terms and these concepts are packed with ideas, then you compare concepts with the world.
- Causal theory of race -- even if you have mistaken ideas, you know what it is, and you can modify it. Linguistic division of labor.
- Appiah: both theories are false: there are no races, there is nothing which is signed,w hich you can point towards. 

---

## Lecture 4: From Racial Eliminativism to Racial Formation
- Eliminativism, conservationism, revisionism. 

W.E.B. Du Bois
- The conservation of races
- Was DuBois a naturalist, skeptic, constructivist, or a pluralist about race? Clearly not a racial skeptic. 
- DuBois is a conservationist, a racial egalitarian. Thinks eliminating race talk will not help bring about justice. 

Kwame Anthony Appiah
- Du Bois follows the "classic dialectic" -- groups are different and unequal. The critical response denies the difference. There are no differences, you've made things up, and revalue the thing which is undervalued.
- Yet DuBois never transcended the scientific notion
- DuBois' own history is complicated. 
- Common impulses is all that remains. These bind people a posteriori as properties of racial groups
- There's no predictive/causal structure of the impulses
- Du Bois begin to be hinting towards a social construct understanding of race.
- Causal theory (referential) account of race; meaning is not in the head (Hilary Putnam)

---

## Lecture 5: Racial Population Naturalism
- Racial essentialist naturalists -- the De Gabineaus, the Madison Grants, etc.
- These folks are new -- maybe you can carve it at its joints
- Do not conflate the racist population naturalists with the racial population naturalists. Can you divide the human species in a significant way?

Robin Andreasen
- There are two kinds of questions we can ask: sociological questions and biological questions
- Is there a biologically substantive way of dividing up the subspecies
- Philosophers of science -- debate on whether you can even have subspecies
- Common sense tells us a lot of things
- Science contradicts common sense often
- When you say that races are biologically unreal, there are two claims
  - Strong claim: there are no biologically objective ways to define race
  - Weak claim: Biology fails to vindicate commonsense ideas about race.
  - Appiah and Zack have kind of blended the etwo together.
  - Constructivists and skeptics correct about the weak claim, but not the strong claim.
- Cladistic approach: races are ancestor descendant sequences of breeding populations, or groups of such sequences, that share a common oranges. Races once existed, but they are on their way out. 
- Human activity is causing race to lose it sbiological reality.
- Arguments against the biological concept of race
  - No subspecies argument
  - No human subspecies argument.  
- Differences are clinal, they change gradually. Differences are not real in the snese of fcreating subspecies
- One natural classification refects geneological relationships among organisms. You see monophyletic units form within a phylogeneitc tree. 
- It's not totally implausible to cut the tree in this specific way, joint cutting.
- You can have gene differences, etc. 
- Races as clades: some complications
  - The folk category Asian is not a cladistic race.
- Biological races are dynamic -- they change all the time. Biological race can exist and chnange over time. But noww we are coming into contact with one another, so races do not exist.
- Tracing ancesotrs and looking at ancestral populations.

Philip Kitcher
- How can biologists deploy the notion of race in a reasonable way?
- Agrees with what all the eliminativists say about an essentialist concept of race
- Necessary conditions for a biological concept of race. 
- Committed to the history of reproductive separation. Phenotypic differences are sustained through transmission of genes.
- Distinct phenotypes maintain themselve,s done through mechanisms that keep people from reproducing which each other.                                                                               
- There was a lot of race-mixing happening. 
- There isn't a biological reason: it's geogrpahic or there are social barriers/explanations.
- Most people reproducew 
- Suppose races are bohand $$a$-
- Kitcher:a about group sbeing reproductiel==vely usolatred from oe moanther. You could start creatinng races. 
- The caldistic approaches not cnote omproiv=
- Ethnicity and culture -- the relations herein

Joshua Glasgow
- Humans are all equal, because any culture can leanrn any culture anywhere'
- Social constructionists are talking about ethnicity, and we're trying to understand race here.
- Glasgow: you can't just gloss over the consequences, South and North East Asian are supposed to be close but they have radically different phenotypes
- Talking about a division based purportedly on a scientific reason, but now dealing with the pragmatic stuff.
- Appiah wanted the truth, but maybe wanted to get the pragmatic consequences.
- It becomes a leverage debate.
- Objections
  - An account with 9 races is too different
  - Cladistic approach deals with races disappearing, but not of races still persisting
  - Reproductively isolated groups do not map onto the phenotypical groupings which form the essence of the folk concept of race
  - Scientss/biologists are not themselves the arbiters of the meaning of race. 
- Kitcher: There are mechanisms which keep what we call races relatively siolated reproductively-wise.
- Glasgow defeats the population naturalists
- Final contender: geographical populations: clusters of genes tend to look like races
- You begin getting pluralist conceptions of race; maybe you ought to have a biological race and a social race. 
- "A Third Way in the Race Debate", 2006
- Eliminativist argument: 
  1. If race is an illusion, racial terms should be eliminated from public discourse.
  2. Race is an illusion.
  3. Racial terms should be eliminated from public discourse
- Everyone attacks/defends "Race is an illusion".
- Appiah's anti-realist argument
- Onto-Semantic Constraint: all parties of the debate converge on the idea that ontological theories of race must be consistent with the best semantics of race. 
  - Andreeson is just changing the meaning of the word 'race'. 
  - All approaches suffer from a monistic worldview. Here come the pluralists. Why do they have to be one thing. They can be two, but you can't equivocate.
- Racial reconstructionism: create a discourse to reconstruct the meaning o f racial terms to be semantically, ontologically, normatively "kosher" (???)
- Even if "race" (biology ) is an illusion, race* can be useful in public discourse and retained.
- Reconstructionist argument.
  1. If either 'race' or race* are not illusions and useful,then racial terms should be retained in public discourse.
  2. "Race" is an illusion and not useful.
  3. Race* is not an illusion and useful
  4. Racial terms should be retained in public discourse.

## Lecture 6: 

Sally Haslanger
- There is a reality to race which isn't being captured.
- We can't merely say that the meaning of race is vacuous, 
- Race picks out a social type, and means different things in different cases.

---

## Lecture 7: Ron Mallon, Normative Race
- Puts philosophy of race on the map
- Philosophy of language
- Rawls made political philosophy back on the map
- Ron Mallon
- Constructionist: American society was not and is not divided along racial lines because nature made it that way. Are open to transformation by collective action.
- On a constructionist theory of race, passing should be possible and explicable.
- No Travel Constriant: race is dependent on culture
- Passing Constraint: passing is possible and explicable. 
- Reality constraint: race should be explanatory
- Race does not travel.
- The concept of race is heuristically incoherent
