## Lecture 1: A New Division of the World
- Race is a fairly modern conception -- the earliest you're going to find it is in the 16th century
- Orbis Terrarum (isidorian map) -- one of the ways in which people divided up the entire world
- Religion is the basis for the division of the world
  - Noah's Arc: Noah's sons, Shem (East), Ham (Africa), and Japheth (West).
  - Cursed be Canaan, a servant of servants shall he be unto his bretheren. Not only is Ham the servant, but also his son Canaan -- introduction of a reproductive principle
- Orientalism
  - You don't need race to hate Muslims, e.g.
  - "Orient" / "Occident" comes from "oriens" (the rising, e.g. the East) and "occidens" (the setting, e.g. the West)
  - the 'near est', 'middle east', 'far easit' -- orient, not occident
- Spread of Islam -- a movmeent to take back Holy Lands
- Crusades -- a movement to take back Holy Lands
  - But first you do i s==s join the crusades.
  - Reconquistra -- driving the argument that you need t =o be Japanese or O+Korean
  -  Moriscos / marramonocs
  - 
- "New Christians" have secod-class students.
- Christian lurity: less about affirming bloodlinea n dmore about irming one images' bloodliees are (pi0-3)
- Slavery without rce -- historically, slavery was a common practice. e.g. across languages
- Rise of feudalism in North and central Europea
- La Reconquista -- a system in the Iberian Peninsula
  - La Encomienda -- to entrust, a system used byt he PSniah to control and idstribute labor
  - A way of motivating people to fight. 
  - los adelantados 
  - people on conquered territory become subjects of the Spanish monarchy
  - Is it slavery? Sort of
  - If you convert, then... you can't enslave
  - 15% of the profits that Christopher Columbus made from the voyage, he got to keep. Columbus wanted to make indigenous people slaves.
- Justifying the conquest -- who has dominion over these lands?
  - Satan was running amuck in America: convert?
- Treaty of Tordesillas (1494) -- a line drawn down the Atlantic Ocean, dividing the world between Spain and Portugal
  - Portugal got Brazil
  - Spain got the rest of the Americas
  - Portugal got Africa -- Portugal become the slavers -- the first slaves to the Americas come through Portuguese slavers
- Spain and human rights -- you can trace a lot of human rights to these times
  - Laws of Burgos, 1512
  - Spanish Requirimiento, tell Natives to submit to Spanish rule or be at war
  - Sublimis Deus, 1537 -- declared indigenous Americans rational
  - Native Americans New Laws, 1542
- The idea -- these are humans. if you want to exploit their labor, how do you do so?
- Valladolid Debates, 1550-1551. Promoted by the king of Spain, Carlos V. Pitted Gines de Sepulveda vs. Bartolome de las Casas.
  - Sepulveda: the official historian and theologian of the Spanish Crown. You have two weapons: the Bible and Aristotle. Colonialism is a civilizing task emancipating those living in barbarity. Virtue, humanity, and true religion is more valuable than gold and silver.
  - Aristotle: the telos of Native Americans is to be slaves
  - Ingenuity does not prove equality to the Spanishing
  - Worship of false idols, cannibalism, sacrifice of the innocent, sins against the divine.
  - Bartolome de las Casas. Emigrated to Hispaniola in 1502. Gives up his land, etc. Initially: you can't just force someone to convert, you need to save their soul. Cannot be brutal.
  - Argued for a misread of Aristotle and Aquinas. Four ways of being a barbarian
    - Exhibiting cruel and irrational behavior
    - Lacking a written language
    - Having no understanding of justice or civilization
    - Not being Christian
  - "Barbarian" -- from undeveloped language, "bar bar bar"
  - Still talking about religion -- need to take Jesus Christ
  - Is De Las Casas' defense anti-racist? We probably still don't have a concept of race yet
  - De Las Casas: the Indians are too weak to be slaves, but some people thrive -- the children of Ham.
- Decartes' undergraduate logic textbook written in the Americas
- La Casta -- hierarchical system of caste systems and classifications which is starting to look a lot like race. Proto-Lamarkian ideas about race, you might have good stock, but if you're not born in the right soil, you're not going to be as good.
  - Peninsular -- born on Iberian Peninsula, parents are white and European
  - Creoles -- born in America, parents are white and European
  - Mestizos -- European and Native American
  - Mulattoes -- European and African descent
  - Africans -- free and enslaved
  - Native Americans -- Indians, Aztec, Maya, inca, etc.
- They don't have Darwinian evolution or Lamarck yet, merely sympethetic -- somehow it tends to pass off into your offspring. 
- Racial science, and moves away a little bit from religion and towards other proto-scientific things
- Certain castes get denied certain things.
- The Black Legend
  - Due to politics, religious tensions, and to a little jealousy, European powers begin a propaganda campaign against Spain and Catholicism
  - Spaniards who came to the New Wordl were greedy conquistadors, but the English who came are peaceful colonists seeking liberty.
- Immanuel Kant -- brutal writing on the Spaniard. There is a non-European taste
- Race in the United States
  - First group of African slaves come to Jamestwon in 1619
  - Most laborers in the US were indentured servants
  - initially, Africans were treated as indentured servants.
  - The Portguese initially baptized the slaves, so they need to be indentured servants; when they filled out their contract, they were done
  - Slow transformation into race-based chattel slavery, motivated by three factors
    - Demand for labor on the colonies exceeds the supply of indentured servants coming from Europe
    - Life for an indentured servant sucks, many of them run away, easy fro white indentured servants to blend in as free men
    - Revolt, people keep on revolting -- Bacon's Rebellion, 1676. Burned down Jamestown, Virginia, a large number of people from different classes.
    - 1705 Virginia Slave Codes -- a lot of thought put into the slave codes. how do you stop thes efrom happening?
  - Virginia Slave Codes of 1705
    1. Established new property rights for slave owners -- humans as property
    2. Legal and free trading of slaves
    3. Prohibited Blacks, regardless of free status, from owning weapons
    4. Prohibited Whites from being employed by Blacks
    5. ...
  - This is where the divison between White and Black emerges here.
  - How to distinguish free from bonded labor? How to prevent lower classes from revolting? Slaves from Africa provide the perfect solution. Any Black woman's child is a slave. Your father could be a rapist. Endless supply of labor, no need to import, and you have skin color as a marker of slavery. Also a psychological reason fro poor whites to buy in.
  - Thomas Jefferson, 1743-1826. 
    - Monogenesis: humans have one origin. Christian worldview.
    - Polygenesis: the human species have multiple origins.
    - If races are supposed to be distinct, then where did they come from? Does the existence of race undermine genesis? Kant is the hero, because he gives a monogenesis account which explains multiple races.
    - Seeing the divisions -- but what are the geneses? Jefferson -- "seeds"
