## Lecture 1: A New Division of the World
- Race is a fairly modern conception -- the earliest you're going to find it is in the 16th century
- Orbis Terrarum (isidorian map) -- one of the ways in which people divided up the entire world
- Religion is the basis for the division of the world
  - Noah's Arc: Noah's sons, Shem (East), Ham (Africa), and Japheth (West).
  - Cursed be Canaan, a servant of servants shall he be unto his bretheren. Not only is Ham the servant, but also his son Canaan -- introduction of a reproductive principle
- Orientalism
  - You don't need race to hate Muslims, e.g.
  - "Orient" / "Occident" comes from "oriens" (the rising, e.g. the East) and "occidens" (the setting, e.g. the West)
  - the 'near est', 'middle east', 'far easit' -- orient, not occident
- Spread of Islam -- a movmeent to take back Holy Lands
- Crusades -- a movement to take back Holy Lands
  - But first you do i s==s join the crusades.
  - Reconquistra -- driving the argument that you need t =o be Japanese or O+Korean
  -  Moriscos / marramonocs
  - 
- "New Christians" have secod-class students.
- Christian lurity: less about affirming bloodlinea n dmore about irming one images' bloodliees are (pi0-3)
- Slavery without rce -- historically, slavery was a common practice. e.g. across languages
- Rise of feudalism in North and central Europea
- La Reconquista -- a system in the Iberian Peninsula
  - La Encomienda -- to entrust, a system used byt he PSniah to control and idstribute labor
  - A way of motivating people to fight. 
  - los adelantados 
  - people on conquered territory become subjects of the Spanish monarchy
  - Is it slavery? Sort of
  - If you convert, then... you can't enslave
  - 15% of the profits that Christopher Columbus made from the voyage, he got to keep. Columbus wanted to make indigenous people slaves.
- Justifying the conquest -- who has dominion over these lands?
  - Satan was running amuck in America: convert?
- Treaty of Tordesillas (1494) -- a line drawn down the Atlantic Ocean, dividing the world between Spain and Portugal
  - Portugal got Brazil
  - Spain got the rest of the Americas
  - Portugal got Africa -- Portugal become the slavers -- the first slaves to the Americas come through Portuguese slavers
- Spain and human rights -- you can trace a lot of human rights to these times
  - Laws of Burgos, 1512
  - Spanish Requirimiento, tell Natives to submit to Spanish rule or be at war
  - Sublimis Deus, 1537 -- declared indigenous Americans rational
  - Native Americans New Laws, 1542
- The idea -- these are humans. if you want to exploit their labor, how do you do so?
- Valladolid Debates, 1550-1551. Promoted by the king of Spain, Carlos V. Pitted Gines de Sepulveda vs. Bartolome de las Casas.
  - Sepulveda: the official historian and theologian of the Spanish Crown. You have two weapons: the Bible and Aristotle. Colonialism is a civilizing task emancipating those living in barbarity. Virtue, humanity, and true religion is more valuable than gold and silver.
  - Aristotle: the telos of Native Americans is to be slaves
  - Ingenuity does not prove equality to the Spanishing
  - Worship of false idols, cannibalism, sacrifice of the innocent, sins against the divine.
  - Bartolome de las Casas. Emigrated to Hispaniola in 1502. Gives up his land, etc. Initially: you can't just force someone to convert, you need to save their soul. Cannot be brutal.
  - Argued for a misread of Aristotle and Aquinas. Four ways of being a barbarian
    - Exhibiting cruel and irrational behavior
    - Lacking a written language
    - Having no understanding of justice or civilization
    - Not being Christian
  - "Barbarian" -- from undeveloped language, "bar bar bar"
  - Still talking about religion -- need to take Jesus Christ
  - Is De Las Casas' defense anti-racist? We probably still don't have a concept of race yet
  - De Las Casas: the Indians are too weak to be slaves, but some people thrive -- the children of Ham.
- Decartes' undergraduate logic textbook written in the Americas
- La Casta -- hierarchical system of caste systems and classifications which is starting to look a lot like race. Proto-Lamarkian ideas about race, you might have good stock, but if you're not born in the right soil, you're not going to be as good.
  - Peninsular -- born on Iberian Peninsula, parents are white and European
  - Creoles -- born in America, parents are white and European
  - Mestizos -- European and Native American
  - Mulattoes -- European and African descent
  - Africans -- free and enslaved
  - Native Americans -- Indians, Aztec, Maya, inca, etc.
- They don't have Darwinian evolution or Lamarck yet, merely sympethetic -- somehow it tends to pass off into your offspring. 
- Racial science, and moves away a little bit from religion and towards other proto-scientific things
- Certain castes get denied certain things.
- The Black Legend
  - Due to politics, religious tensions, and to a little jealousy, European powers begin a propaganda campaign against Spain and Catholicism
  - Spaniards who came to the New Wordl were greedy conquistadors, but the English who came are peaceful colonists seeking liberty.
- Immanuel Kant -- brutal writing on the Spaniard. There is a non-European taste
- Race in the United States
  - First group of African slaves come to Jamestwon in 1619
  - Most laborers in the US were indentured servants
  - initially, Africans were treated as indentured servants.
  - The Portguese initially baptized the slaves, so they need to be indentured servants; when they filled out their contract, they were done
  - Slow transformation into race-based chattel slavery, motivated by three factors
    - Demand for labor on the colonies exceeds the supply of indentured servants coming from Europe
    - Life for an indentured servant sucks, many of them run away, easy fro white indentured servants to blend in as free men
    - Revolt, people keep on revolting -- Bacon's Rebellion, 1676. Burned down Jamestown, Virginia, a large number of people from different classes.
    - 1705 Virginia Slave Codes -- a lot of thought put into the slave codes. how do you stop thes efrom happening?
  - Virginia Slave Codes of 1705
    1. Established new property rights for slave owners -- humans as property
    2. Legal and free trading of slaves
    3. Prohibited Blacks, regardless of free status, from owning weapons
    4. Prohibited Whites from being employed by Blacks
    5. ...
  - This is where the divison between White and Black emerges here.
  - How to distinguish free from bonded labor? How to prevent lower classes from revolting? Slaves from Africa provide the perfect solution. Any Black woman's child is a slave. Your father could be a rapist. Endless supply of labor, no need to import, and you have skin color as a marker of slavery. Also a psychological reason fro poor whites to buy in.
  - Thomas Jefferson, 1743-1826. 
    - Monogenesis: humans have one origin. Christian worldview.
    - Polygenesis: the human species have multiple origins.
    - If races are supposed to be distinct, then where did they come from? Does the existence of race undermine genesis? Kant is the hero, because he gives a monogenesis account which explains multiple races.
    - Seeing the divisions -- but what are the geneses? Jefferson -- "seeds"

## Lecture 2: American Whiteness

The Rise of "Race"
- Basic elements of race which need to all come together
- Religion: religious conflicts, religious myths on the origin and purpose of humanity, cutting up the world
- Slavery (chattel): you need exploitable labor that is marked an dunlikely to win a revolt.
- Settler colonialism -- not just any kind of colonialism. Need to justify the occupation of what was formerly foreign land.
- Xenophobia -- a strong sense of nationalism, a strong sense of "us" and "them"

Colonialism
- A system in which an outside group takes control over foreign land and controls its resources and often its peoplpe
- Most forms of colonialism become exploitative: a metropole seeks to derive profits by exploiting the colony.
- Often a doctrine of "terra nullius", or folks are not using their resources well.
- Post-colonianlism: rebuilding projects by independent states that at one point were colonies.
- Maybe post-colonial never led to de-colonial. Is there still a logic of resource extraction from one part of the world to another?
- Settler colonialism is not just / for the metropole's profit, but to establish permanent settlement in a territory.
- Settler colonialism is a structure rather than an event. It is achieved through treaties.
- Terra nullius -- the land was empty

Religious Differences: Latin vs. Anglo Europe
- Anglo Europe: between Protestants and Catholics.
- Latin Europe is more concerned with the division between Christians and Muslims.

Colonization of the America
- Latin colonists came with particular objectives. Mainly single men coming to make money.
- Some people explicit aim to spread the goslpel of Christianity.

- Lation-MAerican patriotism. MUlti-axis paradigm of race
- In Anglo-American racism, you have the notion of hypodescent, one-drop rule

The Ancients
- Carving nature, Plato, 427-347 BCE. Nature has divisions. There are natural places to carve up things.
- Aristotle, 842-322 BCE. THat which a thing has in common with toher like things without which it would not be that thing: essence. 

The Moderns
- Bernier, 1620-1688. Four or five species who diffeences are solarge that they serve a diviosn of the earth. 
- Color is only an accident upon them
- These are all white people -- you can yet carve nature at its joints.
- Tribalism, religiosity, etc. artificially divide you -- but you are part of a larger group

Adam and Eve, A New Division of the Earth
- The Abrahamic tradition has subscribed to monogenesis.
- Isaac La Peyrere made a case for polygenesis in *men Before Adam8.
- Polygenesis: any belief ror theory that the human species had multiple origins.
- By mid-1750s, Europeans believe that there are racial differences
- Monogenesis (e.g. Montesqieu) -- differences result from climate, geopgrahy, and diet.
- Jean-Baptiste Lamarck: the theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics. Organisms pass onto their offspring physical characteristics that they have acquired during their lifetime. 
- Polygenesists: traits are unchaniging and perspesit over time, inferiroity is an original and esssential trait. 
- Immaneul Kant, 1724 - 1804
  - One of the frist anthropologsts
  - A racist (?)
  - In his time, more well-known for his anthropology than his philosophy.
- Blumbenbach
  -  Blueman is a reacial egaliatiran, but htings that race is degenrate
  - Degeneration theory
  - All the beaitufl people came frmo the Cuacauses and you get to oht==
- Joseph Arhur de Gobineau, *An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races* (1853), maybe the most racist text for its time.
  - Developed the theory of the Aryan master race
  - "Aryan" taken from a Hindu legend, preserving superior Aryan racial heritage
  - Buddhism and Islam taken to be religions of decay.
- Francis Galton (1822 - 1911)
  - Introduced Eugenics
  - Darwinian eugenics which the Nazis use -- any improvements we make now are not going to pass on to their kids. Why educate dumb people? Their children will be dumb
  - Lamarckian eugenics takes hold in Latin America. You don't have to have a degenerate race. Improving people will pass on better genes tot he next generation. Latin America tries to whiten themselves.
    - You get health and education programs, etc. 
    - Lamarckian eugenics have horrible outcomes too
  - Regression towards mediocrity in hereditary stature.
  - Social programs helping the poor are dysgenic. 
- Madison Grant (1865, 1937)
  - *The Passing of the Great Race* (1916)
  - White folks have degenerate races as well
  - The Great Nordic race is kind of newer, so their genes are a little bit weaker. The Nordic people are also the most brave people. The swarthy Latin people are seducing the women: Mediterranean and "Iberian" subspecies, etc.
  - The United States is not a melting pot, it's a Nordic nation, and the Nordic race is going to pass away.
  - Quoted repeatedly in Congress while passing racist legislation
- 1700s Anti-German Zenophobia
  - Benjamin Franklin: they do not assimilate, they herd together and establish their languages to the exclusion of ours. 
  - "Why shuold Pennsylvania, founded by the English, become a colony of aliens?"

First US Citizenship / Immigration Laws
- The constitution didn't talk about immigration -- they can't get enough coming in
- Congress shall have the power to establish a uniform rule of naturalization
- 1790 Naturalization Act: free white persons of good character and living in the US for 2 years

Anti-Irish and Catholic Xenophobia in the 1800s
- White Anglo-Saxon Protestants (WAPS)
- WAPS came to see themselves as the "real" Americans
- Catholicism seen as inherently foreign and dangerous to "real" America
- Catholic church represented monarchy, etc.
- The "Irish-Iberian" thesis / hypothesis
- Know-nohthing party, "Americans must rule Americans"
- Repealing the naturalization act.
- Race is part of a nation-building process. But they still let them naturalize, which was not the case against black, inidgenous, asian peoples

American Whiteness
- Black and indigenous ameircans are ineligible for US citizenship
- In some cases, it is about being free. Dred Scott v. Sanford, 1857
- Elk v. Wilkins, 1884 -- indigenous man just wants to vote.
- It i sonly until 1924 that Indians are given citizenship
- Asian ineligibility for naturalized US citizenship
  - Chinese exclusion acts, 1875
  - Takao Ozawa v. US, 1922
- Asiatic barred zone -- not even residence in the United States allowed.
- George Shishim, born in the Ottoman Empire, moves to the US and becomes LAPD. Arrests the son of a prominent lawyer. Argument: Shishim should have never been a cop, he should not have been an American citizen, he is not 'white'
- Judge Hutton getting ready to rule in George Shishim v. United States (1909) that an "Arab" identity was non-white
- Shishim: "If I am a Mongolian, then so was Jesus, because we came from the same land." 
- Hutton rules Shishim white by law.
- Why is Middle Eastern included in Caucasian? -- the consistency is how close are you to Christianity. It starts to whiten you.
- Orient / Occident: Islam can darken you.
- Takao Ozawa. Lived in the United States for 20 years. Ozawa applies for US citizenship. US denies his application because he is of the Japanese race. Ozawa denies: American education, Christian churches, etc. -- rolls up his sleeve and puts his arm next to every judge and says that they are as white
- Is Takao white? No -- the appellant in this case is clearly of a race which is not *Caucasian*. 
- Race, as defined by biological anthropology, trumps ethnicity (culture and appearance) in determining eligibility for US citizenship.
- Bhagat Singh Thind -- fought for the US in World War I. Gave him citizenship, but then took it away -- he's not white. He hears the result of Takao Ozawa -- according tot he anthropology of the time and the fact he was from a high Indu caste, he was technically of the Caucasian race and could not be denied citizneship on grounds of not being white.
- Is "Caucasian" enough to determine a peron's whiteness? The court changes again -- not "Caucasian", but rather "white", not of scientific origin, of familiar observation and knowledge -- Hindus are readily distinguishable from "folk theory" white individuals

Race in Latin America
- Wars of independence led by Creoles -- Peninsulares taking their jobs.
- Officially end the caste system, but it continues socially: Blanqueamiento
- If we cna get more white people to have children and discourage darker skinned children to have children, the population will be whitened.
- Argentina's constitution, Article 25, does not allow closing immigrants from Europe. When the Nazis came over after the war, so many settled in Argentina.
- Race comes to be linked with phenotypes, especially skin color, and culture / class / social standing
- Siblings of the same parents can belong to different races under Blanqueamiento. It's not about heritage, it's metaphysically about skin color. 
- Jose Vasconcelos (1882 - 1959): there is a purpose / spirit that undergirds the rise and fall of civilizations and races. This spirit is like a current in a body of water. There is a conflict between two white races of Europe: Latins and the Anglos. The French / Spanish / Portuguese / Italian against the English and the US.
- Latin America is in a prime position to play a key role in "history's mandate" -- history seeks the fusion of peoples -- all of the races come together and produces the cosmic race
  - Asian, Black, White comes together
- In Mexico, there are many problems -- but it is a Mestizo nation. Look at the flags: an indigenous symbol and European colors.
- Madison Grant sees this and says this is the problem -- you can't have the melting pot. The absorption of blood of the conquistadors byt he "native Indian population" has produced the Mexican.
