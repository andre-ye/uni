## 10/12 OH Points
- Interogating what it means for race to be a master category
- Domestic vs international conceptions of race
- Race in the digital space. Bodily representation, e.g. AR/VR, emoji skin color
- Omi and Winnant -- you need a kind of sufficiently foreign other to instigate a kind of topology?
- Race in the digital sense


- Using Omi and Winnant to understand race specifically -- as a "master concept", or what?
- What distinguishes race from gender? If we say that both are social constructs, then it seems to get very difficult.
