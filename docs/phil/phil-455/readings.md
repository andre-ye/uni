## Week 1: The (His-)Story of Race

When and were has race emerged?
Race is largely a product of the 19th century.

### *Race: The Power of an Illusion*, "The Difference Between Us"
- Race is not based on biology but an idea we ascribe to biology
- Race in sports -- "there are genetic bases for athletic activity"
- Can populations be bundled into "races"? How many races are there?
- The measured genetic variation among people is really very small. We are genetically among one of the most similar of all species.
- Performance and behavior are attributed to race often
- Scientists have searched for 200 years for a biological basis for race. Some measured facial angles or skull size sizes, eye shape, hair form, brain color.
- Scientists are part of their social context -- they are not merely driven by an objective scientific ideal, these ideals are socially situated.
- Extinction thesis: some races have naturally higher or lower mortality, so the races with lower mortality will eventually become extinct.
  - Becomes a basis for eugenics and social policy
- A single drop of "black blood" makes you black
- White racial purity and eugenics -- arises from simple Mendelian genetics, biological and moral features emerging from mother and father
- The "whin tribe" -- Black, white, and Indian ancestry, passing for white but genetically "tainted"; Virginian "mongrols"
- Nazi eugenics come from American eugenics and race science
- Hitler's Aryan race -- at the top of nature's hierarchy
- Jesse Owens breaks the Aryan myth at the 1936 Olympics
- But how to handle this? Grant physical superiority but deny intellectual superiority
  - **Objection!** Okay... but, in 'reality', why did African-Americans do better?
- Racial scientists: mark physical prowess as a sign of intellectual inferiority and closeness to nature.
- What is your measurement device? Skin color, hair texture, etc.
  - **Objection!** Sure, but surely in our collective phenomenal appearance we independently determine / assign individual races. What is the basis?
- Dark melanin blocks UV radiation, so it's an advantage in the tropics -- one hypothesis, sunlight is essential for having enough vitamin D. So you need to have enough sunlight to have enough vitamin D, but not too much sunlight to get skin cancer.
  - **Objection!** So this is a sort of biological determination...
- One idea, populations vary by distance -- so they are continuous distributions rather than discrete ones.
  - **Objection!** What if social conditions reify themselves so that continuous distributions do form? Isn't it a contingency rather than a necessity that so called 'mixing' happens? What if our beliefs reflect back into reality?
  - **Objection!** We can cluster, we don't have to be discrete... e.g. with political beliefs
- Jewish teams dominated basketball in the 1930s
  - There are strong cultural reasons why people choose and train in certain sports over others
  - By 1992, most of the NBA was African-American
  - By 2000s, 20% of NBA starters are foreign-born
- Is race deeper than skin? But most human variation is non-correlative, e.g. with height or weight (**Objection!** really?)
- **Objection!** Are we fetishizing biology? Why are genetics the fundamental basis of individuals? Why do we even give them significance?
- Statistical issues and difficulties -- now you're neglecting culture.
- There can be accumulations of genes in one part of the group and not others -- it's better understood in terms of geography
- All humans are products of a second migration out of Africa; the first migration led to species which died out
- Human variation does not map onto "race"
- There is huge genetic diversity in Africa
- **Objection!** Looking towards genetics is a sort of appeal to the noumenal realm
- "We're all mongrels, we've always been mixing"
- Race is "real" even though it is not biological.
- Race as a social construct has a lot to do with an individual's outcome.
- Capitalism sets up  a system of racial reification.
  - Capital is inherited
- We can unmake race

### *Race: The Power of an Illusion*, "The Story We Tell"

- "all men are created equal"
- It's never about how you look, but how you give meaning to how you look
- Race has a history and is constructed by a soceity to further certain political and economic goals.
- Jefferson, *Notes on the State of Virginia*
- Arguably Jefferson articulates the first theory of race in the United States. If in so we are all equal, then how can he own so many slaves?
- How can you promote liberty, freedom, democracy; but also slavery and exploitation at the same time? By essentializing biology. Unalienable rights only apply to certain people.
- Universality is always partial
- Initially, blackness and whiteness were not yet clear categories of identities. They were more likely to distinguish between Christians and heathens than white or non-white. Status was more fundamental to who they were than their color.
- Indians are not much different than Euoropean minds
- The problem with the Indians was not race but culture, but they 'could be civilized'
- Jefferson, introduced by European Enlightenment ideals
- Those crossing over to the West thought that the Indians were savages who were preventing westwards expansion.
- 1820s: a Cherokee alphabet created, establishing a government and Constitution patterneda fter the United States.
- What whites saw as greater representation and democracy was for the Indians greater agency to infringe upon their land.
- Andrew Jackson, the 'common man'
- The rise of the nation, the idea of shared governance based on common features. In opposition to Englightenment ideal of united humanity.
- What is the "nature" of Indians?
  - Philosophically, the move here is from Cartesian self-doubt towards radical naive objectivism: to claim to know the noumena, the true thing-in-itself of race
- Now told to embrace themselves -- preserve themselves as distant Indians, no longer to become like whites
- 19th century, lots of public lectures on the nature of men, people are avidly interested in natural sciences.
- Samuel Morton -- *Crania Americana*, purely scientific methods to investigate carnial capacity and structure, which has implications for brain size
  - Finds blacks at the bottom and white men at the top
  - The reflection -- a metaphysical argument of oneself as reflected in the noumena
- God never established equality of the races -- why should it be so? -- interesting to think about how justification must always spill over into a measure of faith
- From Jefferson to the 1850s: there are deep, irrevokable gulfs between the races
- America's new role abroad
- Race cuts across class
- Poor white people -- you may be poor, you may have miserable lives, but you are white
- Indians and blacks are used as representations of Filipinos
- There is not a gap between the "ordinary man's" conception of race and the scientist's concpetion
- The highway of human progress
- 1904 world's fair

## Week 2: The Concept of ``Race''

### "The Conservation of Races", W.E.B. Du Bois (1897)
- The "American Negro" has been led to minimize race distinctions towards a monogenetic origin. Liberal human brotherhood and whatnot...
- Yet, we must acknowledge that humans are divided into races, and the US is the synthesis of the most "extreme types"
- We must take the question of race *holistically*: what is the real meaning of race?
- What is the criteria of racial differences?
- Frustratingly for scientists, the criteria of race are very intermingled, or independent of each other.
- The "final word of science" two or three great families of human beings
- The scientific doctrine of human brotherhood: we have more likenesses than weaknesses
- Physical differences do not matter too much with regards to the role groups of men have played in human progress, but there are definitely differences. *Perhaps it transcends the scientific definition.*
- **The history of the world is the history, not of individuals, but of groups, not of nations, but of races.**

> "He who ignores or seeks to override the race idea in human history ignores and overrides the central thought of all history."

- A race is a family of human beings, of common "blood" and language, history, traditions.
- The race idea is the "most ingenious invention of human progress"
- There are no great individuals of society; they are merely expressions of vast races.
- We also may believe that America is some sort of racial melting pot
- There are eight races: Slavs, Teutons, English, Romance, Negroes, Semitic, Hindoos, Mongolians.
- What is the real distinction between nations? 
  - Physical differences play an important part
  - There are deeper differences: "spirital, psychial" -- based on the physical, but infinitely transcending. 
  - Teutons are bound by a common history, common laws and religion, similar habits of thought
- Differnt cities and groups abide by different **ideals of life**.
- Political boundaries broadening: from the family to the city to the nation. Races kind of coalesce into broader shared groups. (Why won't they keep on coalescing?)
- Nations begin political splits: the English, constitutional liberty & commercial freedom; German nation, science and philosophy; Romance, literature and art; etc. Guiding towards a perfection of human life.
- **What is the function of race differences in the future?** The Negro race has not yet given civilization its full spiritual message. How should it be delivered? *By the development of race groups, not as individuals, but as races.*
  - Is this a kind of bad multiculturalism? 

> We cannot reverse history; we are subject to the same natural laws as other races, and if the Negro is ever to be a factor in the world's history–if among the gaily-colored banners that deck the broad ramparts of civilizations is to hang one uncompromising black, then it must be placed there by black hands, fashioned by black heads and hallowed by the travail of 200,000,000 black hearts beating in one glad song of jubilee.

- The destiny of Negro people is not absorption by white Americans. It should not be evolution into a single "individual".
- A friction of races -- "race prejudice"
- No "Negro" has failed to eventually ask himself: "Am I American or Negro?"
- Combined race action is stifled under individualism.
- Race predjucie is historically "nothing" but friction between groups of people. If there are basic agreements on laws, language, and religion, and economic life is good, then different national ideas can certainly thrive and develop. (So Dubois is not a strict separationist.)
- We are Americans by our political ideals, language, religion. No more Americanism past there... there, we are Negroes. A "historic" race form the "African fatherland".
- We need race organizations for the products of the Negro mind to emerge. The one refuge for the American Negro is themselves. But his refuge must be genuine and strict: towards the self-advancement of the race.
- The American Negro Academy must be representative, impartial, firm.
- "The Negro people must do it for themselves" -- what to make of this sentiment?
- "Justify our existence"
- Much work is left to do in sociology: bravely face the truth with no apologies.


### "Why There Are No Races", K. Anthony Appiah (1999)
- Two competing notions of what meaning is.
- Ideational: words are an idea. Different races are distinguished by "criteria beliefs" which define the concept
  - One way of understanding the race concept (**empirical/statistical/abductive**): explore what people believe about "races" and see how they must be structured
  - People act on their believes, whether they are true or not.
  - Ideational view: explores contemporary thought about race, but can produce a confusing picture, because our current discussions of race can reproduce "residue" of what they are studying 
- Referential: words identify the things which it signals/refers to.
  - What is the "thing out there" which is picked out?
  - Whatever best explains that thing that people talk about is race
  - Race is a scientific and scholarly term -- there is semantic deference. Taking a historical look at intellectual and political beliefs highlights the core.

A Historiacal View
- Thomas Jefferson's autobiography: the two races cannot live under the same government, thi sis common sense. Race is invoked to explain cultural and social phenomena.
- *Notes on the State of Virginia*: emancipation is inevitable and right, but once emancipated, black shsould be sent elsewhere.
- The poltiical significance of race begins and ends with color. Biolgoical differences: physiology, moral & cognitive psychology, etc. -- distinctions that nature has made. The difference then is significant in its biology.
- It should be noted that biology seems to separate out different aspects of the human body, but Jefferson's "hodgepodge" is more holistic across the body.
- Jefferson writes with a fondness towards Indians.
- "Racialism" -- division of humans into a small number of groups which share certain fundamental characteristics with each other. 
- Matthew Arnold, *On the Study of Celtic Literature*
- Arnold: racial essence is more than physical details: there are moral and literary endowments (e.g. Du Bois)
  - Every race has excellences and defects
- There is much structure to racialist thinking: distinguishing, separation, joining. Characteristics, independence.
  - How do races survive trhough generations?
  - What is racialism's prediction for racial hybrids?
  - The new science of "race' benefits from its association of prestige with the natural sciences.
- Darwin, *The Origin of Species* -- might throw light on the origin of man and its history -- earlier forms
- Races might not be species, *but they may move in that direction*
- Characteristics on different chromosomes are independently assorted (from Mendelian genetics).
- As a biological concept, race at best picks out a few easily visible physical characteristics. Yet they become associated with moral, literary, psychological characters.
- The population concept of race can be employed in population genetics -- there is in fact locality which structures clusters of features under reproduction under a global sphere. But this doesn't happen in humans.
- These groups of features defined by skin color hair, morpholy, etc. corresponding to dominant patterns of characteristics will not provide a central biological notion, and will not correlate with characteristics important for moral/social life.

> The bottom line is this: you can't get much of a race concept, ideationally speaking, from any of these traditions; you can get various possible candidates from the referential notion of meaning, but none of them will be much good for explaining social or psychological life, and none of them corresponds to the social groups we call "races " in America. 



### "The Uncompleted Argument: Du Bois and the Illusion of Race", K. Anthony Appiah (1985)

Introduction
- Science does not have a clear answer on the existence of race
- But statistics of genetic measures can be made to make differences large and small, whatever you want.
- *Objection!* The question is if the genetic basis matters -- so if there indeed were a genetic basis for differences across races, does race exist?  
- Language, moral affections, aesthetic attitudes, etc. are not biological determinned "to any significant degree" (??)
- Confusion between two questions:
  - Does biological difference account for our differences?
  - Does biological similarity account for our similarities?
- W.E.B. Du Bois -- life story is "an autobiography of a race concept"
  - Importantly, we must "assimilate the unbiological nature of races"
  - Du Bois -- not just concerned with the meaning of race, but the truth about it
- Is our understanding of intellectual development of people a movement towards turth? Du Bois represents such an engagement with truth.

"The Conservation of Races"
- Du Bois' extended discussion of race in "The Conservation of Races" (1897)
- The "American Negro" minimizes race discussions because its assumptions were wrong. Yet, human being *are* divided into races, even if we can't find exactly how.
  - Appeal to science: two-three "great families" of human beings
  - Yet unsatisfaction with century: what matter are not mere physical differences, but rather more elusive / "silent" differences.
  - Du Bois: the history of the world is the history of races
  - Movement from a scientific to a sociohistorical notion of race; there are 8 races (as they appear in our phenomena) -- Slavs, Teutons, English, Negroes, Romance race, Semites, Hindus, Mongolians.
- What is the real distinction between races? Physical differences are part of it, but the deeper differences are spiritual, but transcendent of the physical.
