## Week 1: The (His-)Story of Race

When and were has race emerged?
Race is largely a product of the 19th century.

### *Race: The Power of an Illusion*, "The Difference Between Us"
- Race is not based on biology but an idea we ascribe to biology
- Race in sports -- "there are genetic bases for athletic activity"
- Can populations be bundled into "races"? How many races are there?
- The measured genetic variation among people is really very small. We are genetically among one of the most similar of all species.
- Performance and behavior are attributed to race often
- Scientists have searched for 200 years for a biological basis for race. Some measured facial angles or skull size sizes, eye shape, hair form, brain color.
- Scientists are part of their social context -- they are not merely driven by an objective scientific ideal, these ideals are socially situated.
- Extinction thesis: some races have naturally higher or lower mortality, so the races with lower mortality will eventually become extinct.
  - Becomes a basis for eugenics and social policy
- A single drop of "black blood" makes you black
- White racial purity and eugenics -- arises from simple Mendelian genetics, biological and moral features emerging from mother and father
- The "whin tribe" -- Black, white, and Indian ancestry, passing for white but genetically "tainted"; Virginian "mongrols"
- Nazi eugenics come from American eugenics and race science
- Hitler's Aryan race -- at the top of nature's hierarchy
- Jesse Owens breaks the Aryan myth at the 1936 Olympics
- But how to handle this? Grant physical superiority but deny intellectual superiority
  - **Objection!** Okay... but, in 'reality', why did African-Americans do better?
- Racial scientists: mark physical prowess as a sign of intellectual inferiority and closeness to nature.
- What is your measurement device? Skin color, hair texture, etc.
  - **Objection!** Sure, but surely in our collective phenomenal appearance we independently determine / assign individual races. What is the basis?
- Dark melanin blocks UV radiation, so it's an advantage in the tropics -- one hypothesis, sunlight is essential for having enough vitamin D. So you need to have enough sunlight to have enough vitamin D, but not too much sunlight to get skin cancer.
  - **Objection!** So this is a sort of biological determination...
- One idea, populations vary by distance -- so they are continuous distributions rather than discrete ones.
  - **Objection!** What if social conditions reify themselves so that continuous distributions do form? Isn't it a contingency rather than a necessity that so called 'mixing' happens? What if our beliefs reflect back into reality?
  - **Objection!** We can cluster, we don't have to be discrete... e.g. with political beliefs
- Jewish teams dominated basketball in the 1930s
  - There are strong cultural reasons why people choose and train in certain sports over others
  - By 1992, most of the NBA was African-American
  - By 2000s, 20% of NBA starters are foreign-born
- Is race deeper than skin? But most human variation is non-correlative, e.g. with height or weight (**Objection!** really?)
- **Objection!** Are we fetishizing biology? Why are genetics the fundamental basis of individuals? Why do we even give them significance?
- Statistical issues and difficulties -- now you're neglecting culture.
- There can be accumulations of genes in one part of the group and not others -- it's better understood in terms of geography
- All humans are products of a second migration out of Africa; the first migration led to species which died out
- Human variation does not map onto "race"
- There is huge genetic diversity in Africa
- **Objection!** Looking towards genetics is a sort of appeal to the noumenal realm
- "We're all mongrels, we've always been mixing"
- Race is "real" even though it is not biological.
- Race as a social construct has a lot to do with an individual's outcome.
- Capitalism sets up  a system of racial reification.
  - Capital is inherited
- We can unmake race

### *Race: The Power of an Illusion*, "The Story We Tell"

- "all men are created equal"
- It's never about how you look, but how you give meaning to how you look
- Race has a history and is constructed by a soceity to further certain political and economic goals.
- Jefferson, *Notes on the State of Virginia*
- Arguably Jefferson articulates the first theory of race in the United States. If in so we are all equal, then how can he own so many slaves?
- How can you promote liberty, freedom, democracy; but also slavery and exploitation at the same time? By essentializing biology. Unalienable rights only apply to certain people.
- Universality is always partial
- Initially, blackness and whiteness were not yet clear categories of identities. They were more likely to distinguish between Christians and heathens than white or non-white. Status was more fundamental to who they were than their color.
- Indians are not much different than Euoropean minds
- The problem with the Indians was not race but culture, but they 'could be civilized'
- Jefferson, introduced by European Enlightenment ideals
- Those crossing over to the West thought that the Indians were savages who were preventing westwards expansion.
- 1820s: a Cherokee alphabet created, establishing a government and Constitution patterneda fter the United States.
- What whites saw as greater representation and democracy was for the Indians greater agency to infringe upon their land.
- Andrew Jackson, the 'common man'
- The rise of the nation, the idea of shared governance based on common features. In opposition to Englightenment ideal of united humanity.
- What is the "nature" of Indians?
  - Philosophically, the move here is from Cartesian self-doubt towards radical naive objectivism: to claim to know the noumena, the true thing-in-itself of race
- Now told to embrace themselves -- preserve themselves as distant Indians, no longer to become like whites
- 19th century, lots of public lectures on the nature of men, people are avidly interested in natural sciences.
- Samuel Morton -- *Crania Americana*, purely scientific methods to investigate carnial capacity and structure, which has implications for brain size
  - Finds blacks at the bottom and white men at the top
  - The reflection -- a metaphysical argument of oneself as reflected in the noumena
- God never established equality of the races -- why should it be so? -- interesting to think about how justification must always spill over into a measure of faith
- From Jefferson to the 1850s: there are deep, irrevokable gulfs between the races
- America's new role abroad
- Race cuts across class
- Poor white people -- you may be poor, you may have miserable lives, but you are white
- Indians and blacks are used as representations of Filipinos
- There is not a gap between the "ordinary man's" conception of race and the scientist's concpetion
- The highway of human progress
- 1904 world's fair
