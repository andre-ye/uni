## Week 1 Thursday: Introduction
- Baruch / Beendict Spinoza -- born in Amsterdam, 1632, lived in the Netherlands
- Spinoza was very harshly criticized
- Excommunication from the Jewish community -- "because of heretical ideas", but also political elements
- What was so dangerous about Spinoza?
- Spinoza was a "Jewish devil" -- "a Jew first, after a Cartesian, and now an atheist"
- According to Christian doctrine, Jews are atheist or heretical, cursed, materialistic, don't embrace the right God, etc.
- Playing off of an association between Jews and heresy
- Spinoza linked to his Jewish identity, association with various Jewish ideas.
- Spinoza / pantheism controversies

Hegel and Spinoza
- Hegel -- philosophy of history and history of philosophy
    - Reality moves and god manifests through history teleologically, the becoming of Christian spirit, materially trhough ideas.
    - Where does Spinoza fit into Hegel's history?
    - Hegel says that Spinoza's philosophy is an "echo from Eastern lands"; condemns it for being the "Oriental theory of absolute identity"
    - What's wrong with the Oriental theory of absolute identity? It disallows for the "agency of Christianity" and the independence of the Christian soul, lacks Western freedom and dynamisticity
    - Spinoza is a "Jew stuck in Oriental immobility", pure rigidness
    - Hegel builds his project on the hierarchical distinction between the "West" and the "East"
    - "Jews are outside history"
- Western and Christian philosophy has been fundamental in the reception of Spinoza
- Hegel has an extractive / colonial view of philosophy
- Christian supersecessionism
- The default is Christian philosophy and thought; Hegel's philosophy is a Eurocentric, white supremacist, Christian project
- "The beginning point of philosophy is Spinoza" -- high regard for Spinoza's ideas -- but by calling it Oriental and Jewish, Hegel is able to take Spinoza's good ideas (colonial) and make his project better
- The Hegelian dialectic is Christian supremacist, colonial -- Spinoza is pivotal in Hegel's philosophy
- The dialectic is built off of Spinozan ideas

History of "Oriental" Philosophies
- Jewish philosophers drawing from the Jewish tradition -- ideas either rejected or only accepted through Baptism
- Jewish and Islamic philosophy actively censored, burned by Christian Europe
- Condemnation of 1227 -- banning "radical Aristotelianism"
- Justinian closes the Aristotelian academy in Athens in 529, but the one in Alexandria remains open -- very rich culture of Aristotelian philosophy in Muslim lands, which is how Jewish and Muslim philosophers study naturalist and materialist Aristotelian philosophies
- Really challenges ideas in Christian philosophies
- "Western" philosophy -- constructed upon its "Eastern" others
- Spinoza is much more influenced by medieval Jewish philosophers who were committed towards a more naturalist Aristotelian philosophy because they were more in dialogue with medieval philosophy
- Some of Spinoza's central ideas are indebted to these repressed ideas, and helps us understand why his ideas were so controversial, forceful, dangerous

Spinoza, *Ethics*
- Published posthumously
- Ordinary people imagine God to be totally all-powerful
- Spinoza says that God is the only substance, and that God is nature
    - "they very often compare God's power with the power of kings"
    - This is the root of what people get wrong -- God is imagined as a king over reality, just like a king is a king over its subjects
    - They impute free will to God -- this is a category error
- God's power is nothing except active essence
- Anthropomorphism: taking a human construction and put it onto nature / reality, imagining a God which controls the world just as a king does.
- God isn't even free -- contingency and freedom. 
- Humans don't have free will; they think they have free will, and they think that God has free will.
- God is not above an outside reality.
- God -- absolutely infinite, infinity of attributes
- There is no God -- God is Nature; God is substance
- Everything that exists is a mode of reality / substance
- Immanence: God doesn't transcend reality, it is all that is
- Spinoza -- "the first anti-Cartesian"
- Spinoza -- there is not a multiplicity of substances, there is a total unity of substances -- everything isa mode of substance
- There is no sovereignty or hierarchy in nature -- a 'flat ontology'
- Everything is equally a mode of substance

Augustine, *The Literal Meaning of Genesis*
- A lot of Decartes comes from Augustine
- Dualism -- there is God and World, God creates the World through providence
- Humans have body and spirit
- God creates humans with a part outside nature (spirit, will, mind)
- Human exceptionalism
- Spinoza denaturalizes sovereignty -- it is not natural, against the entire Cartesian & Augustinian view, which is built on a series of hierarchies
- Extension is equally an attribute of god as thought is 
- Effects are as much part of god as causes
    - Disrupting the axiology of cause / effect
- "The will cannot be a free cause, but only a necessary one"
- God does not produce any affect by freedom of the will.
