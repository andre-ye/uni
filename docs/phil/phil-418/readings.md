## *Ethics*, Spinoza

EIpAppendix
- God exists necessarily, is unique, is and acts from the necessity of his nature; all things have been predetermined by God, not by freedom of the will, but by God's absolute nature / infinite power
- Teleology is a prejudice -- men always act upon an end and seek ends as understandings
- Men see things in nature which suit their advantage, and so they say that there is God which has created it
- Prejudice turns into superstition -- from "his own temperament" emerges a whole host of different understandings
- Belief in God is fundamentally egoistic: we want special treatment of God such that they may fix certain things to our advantage
- "Nature and the Gods are as mad as men" -- storms, earthquakes, etc. happen because the Gods are angry of wrongs done tot hem by men.
- Standards of truth
- The teleological doctrine inverts everything: it makes the perfect imperfect, the cause the effect, etc.
- "take imagination for intellect"
- Anthropormophism of god -- all men can very easily imagine god and their actions
- "Men have been so mad as to believe that God is pleased by harmony"
- Men judge things byt heir disposition, an dso many controversies arise among men, giving rise to skepticism and relativism
- Mechanisms for explaining nature are only modes of the imagination, rather than substantively the nature of anything
- Why are their so many imperfections if God is perfect -- displeasure, imperfection, etc. are given in the metric of man


EIVpreface -- "On Human Bondage, or the Powers of the Affects"
- Bondage: man's lack of power to moderate and restrain the affects
- The imperfection or perfection of something is dependent on whether its maker's end is known or not.
- Universal ideas: perfection is harmony with the universal idea. 
- Final causes are really abscriptions of appetites
- Perfection and imperfection are only des of thinking. 

Definitions
- Good: what is "useful" to us
- The end of something is appetite
- Virtue = power: virtue is the essence of man insofar as he has teh power of bringing about certain things

EIVp3
- Man's existence is limited and infinitely surpassed by the power of external causes. 

EIVp4
- It is impossible for man not to be part of nature
- Man must be surpassable through alien causes

EIVp8
- The knowledge of good and evil is nohting but an affect of joy or sadness
- Mind is united to the body

EIVp18
- A desire arising from Joy is stronger than one from Sadness
- Desire is the essence of man, through which man strives to persevere
- Joy comes from human power and the power of external cuase; sadness is defined by human power alone. 
- Virtue is about self-preservation, happiness is the ability to self-preserve
- We ought to want virtue for its own sake
- The suicidal are weak-minded and conquered by external causes

EIVp24
- Acting absolutely from virtue is nothing else in us but acting, living, and preserving our being by the guidance of reason
- Acting absolutely from virtue is acting from the laws of our own nature

EIVp25
- No one strives to preserve his being for the sake of anything else.

EIVp31
- If a thing agrees with our nature, it is necessarily good.

EIVp35
- Men will agree in nature if they live according to the guidance of reason, rater than passions
- Human nature is defined by reason

## "Idea for a Universal History with a Cosmopolitan Purpose", Kant

- "A regular progression among freely willed actions"
- Men are neither acting purely by instinct or by rational cosmopolitanism
- "Childish malice and destructiveness" populates human history
- What opinion should we have of our 'species'?

First Proposition
- All natural capacities of a creature are destined to evolve completely to their natural end
- A teleological view of nature
- Otherwise we are faced with an "aimless, random process, and the dismal reign of chance"

Second Proposition
- In man, natural capacities directed towards use of reason develop in the species, not the individual

Third Proposition
-
