## *Ethics*, Spinoza

EIpAppendix
- God exists necessarily, is unique, is and acts from the necessity of his nature; all things have been predetermined by God, not by freedom of the will, but by God's absolute nature / infinite power
- Teleology is a prejudice -- men always act upon an end and seek ends as understandings
- Men see things in nature which suit their advantage, and so they say that there is God which has created it
- Prejudice turns into superstition -- from "his own temperament" emerges a whole host of different understandings
- Belief in God is fundamentally egoistic: we want special treatment of God such that they may fix certain things to our advantage
- "Nature and the Gods are as mad as men" -- storms, earthquakes, etc. happen because the Gods are angry of wrongs done tot hem by men.
- Standards of truth
- The teleological doctrine inverts everything: it makes the perfect imperfect, the cause the effect, etc.
- "take imagination for intellect"
- Anthropormophism of god -- all men can very easily imagine god and their actions
- "Men have been so mad as to believe that God is pleased by harmony"
- Men judge things byt heir disposition, an dso many controversies arise among men, giving rise to skepticism and relativism
- Mechanisms for explaining nature are only modes of the imagination, rather than substantively the nature of anything
- Why are their so many imperfections if God is perfect -- displeasure, imperfection, etc. are given in the metric of man


EIVpreface -- "On Human Bondage, or the Powers of the Affects"
- Bondage: man's lack of power to moderate and restrain the affects
