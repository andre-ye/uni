## Chapter 1: Let the Adventure Begin

### 1.1: Welcome to the Newsroom
- Logic is the rules and principles of reasoning we use every day.
- Logic can also mean the study of our reasoning.
- Formal logical systems/logical systems: a model we create to study our reasoning.

### 1.2: Active Learning 
- Humans learn best by doing.
- *Tabula rasa* vs constructivism
- *Constructivism*: Students must actively build their understanding of the material..

### 1.3: Logic and Form
- We study the form/structure of reasoning an dinferences.
- Structure is a repeatable pattern.
- Replacing words with symbols allows us to reveal forms. 
- Reasoning depends on form.

### 1.4: Entailment = Validity
- In logic, we want to know when some logic guarantees something is true. 
- Deductive logical entailment/entailment.
- A set of premises entails a conclusion if whenever the premises are true, the conclusion is also true.
- A valid argument: the premises entail the conclusion.

### 1.5: Deductive vs Inductive Logic
- Inductive logic: probability and likelihood.
- Deductive logic: guarantee and certainty.
- Principle of Charity: give people the benefit of the doubt and interpret their arguments in a reasonable way, if possible.

## Chapter 2: Weird Cases of Validity

### 2.1: First Weird Case of Validity
- Circular reasoning: the prmeise and conclusion are the same.
- All circular reasoning is valid: if the premise is true, so is the conclusion.
- Circular reasoning is any case of assuming what you are trying to prove.
- Fallacy: a tempting but flawed form of reasoning. 
- Whether circular reasoning is good or bad depends on the circumstances one is in.

### 2.2: Second Weird Case of Validity
- Reasoning from a contradiction is valid.
- Contradiction - occurs when two sentneces say the opposite of each other. 
- Contradiction - a logical falsehood, a sentence that is necessarily false.
- Contradictory set - a group of sentences that can't be true at once.
- Any argument with contradictory premises is valid.
- Validity says that whenever all premises are true, the conclusion must be true. Contradictory premises satisfy this definition trivially because the premises can never be true.
- The only way to show that an argument is invalid is to find a way to make the premises true but the conclusion false.

### 2.3: Third Weird Case of Validity
- A set of premises can be empty. We can still use the definition of validity to assess the argument.
- If there are no premises, the conclusion must always be true.
- We can cehck the validity of an argument with an empty set of premises by checking if the conclusion is necessarily true.
- Logical turth -a sentence that is necessarily true because of the laws of logic.
- An argument with a logically true conclusion is always valid.


### 2.4: Necessary vs. Contingent
- Some statements are neither necessarily true or necessarily false.
- The opposite of necessary is contingent - something that may or may not be true.
- Necessary truths may manifest in a wide variety of laws and backgrounds.

### 2.5: Augmentation
- Augmentation: to add one or more premises to make an argument a new argument.
- When we augment a valid argument, the new premise may add relevant or irrelevant information. It may also contradict existing premises - but the argument will always remain valid.
- Induction - a set of premises may support or confirm a conclusion.
- Validity is a tipping point. once information guarantees the conclusion is true, you cannot destroy validity by adding information - only by taking the information away.

## Chapter 3: Argument Herooics

### 3.1: Identifying Arguments
- Identifying arguments can be surprisingly difficult.
- Argument: premises and conclusion.
- Premise signals: words that indicate a premise. "Because", "since", "for", "given".
- Conclusion signals: words that indicate a conclusion. "Thus", "so", "hence", "therefore".

### 3.2: Sentences
- Anything that can carry information can be studied with logic.
- Sentences can be short in pithy; some ask questions; some make comma ds.
- We care interested in assertions or statements: sentences that make cleaims.
- Sentences int he context of logic have truth values.

### 3.3: Soundness and Premise Truth
- Validity doesn't care about actual truth values; it is a hypothetical/conditional property.
- Truth concerns the relationship between premises and the world.

### 3.4: Bivalence
- Truth and falsity: truth values.
- In logical systems studied in this course, there are only two possible truth values (True and False).
  - These are bivalent logics.

## Chapter 4: Meet the Boolean Connectives

### 4.1: And here is the conjunction &
- BOOL: a logical system, short for Boolean logic.
- & is only allowed to connect two entences together; we technically shouldn't say P&Q&R but we can infer an order of operations.
- If English groups sentences clearly, we need to also group them in bool.
- & - conjunction, ampersand, and
- Sentences are atomic sentences/atoms - they are the building blocks of BOOL.
- Complex sentences are combinations of atomic sentneces.

### 4.2: Or Is it Disjunction v
- Disjunction, wedge, or: v.
- Disjunction is connective; we can use long strings of disjunctions.
- Conjuncts and disjuncts

### 4.3: Not to Neglect Negation ~
- The third connective is ~: negation, tilde, not.
- These three connectives are the Boolean connectives.
- Preserve as much structure whne translating into BOOL as possible.
- Negation always applies to the smallest possible scope of sentence.
- Scope - how much of a sentence a connective governs.
- Default: negation has a narrow scope.

### 4.4: Lost in Translation
- Some bits are lost in translation.
- BOOl helps us study how we reason.
- When we translate a complex sentence into BOOL, we need to capture logical commitmnets.

## Chapter 5: Features of Connectives

### 5.1: Scope
- Scope is the extent of a connective - how much of a sentence it governs.
- Each occurrence of a connective has its own scope.
- Main connective - the connective with wide scope, governs the whole sentence

### 5.2: Arity
- Arity: the number of inputs a connective takes.
- If a connective takes only one input, it is unary. If it takes two inputs, it is binary.

### 5.3: Advanced Boolean Translations
- 'Neither Pia nor Quinn is guilty'. `~P&~Q` or `~(PvQ)`
- You can translate neither/not in two ways.
- When connectives are the same time, we can allow chaining because any way of grouping yields the same result. `(P&Q)&R = P&(Q&R)`.
  - This property does not hold for mixed connectives.
- When you have mixed binary connectives and English doesn't group them, you must give both translations until you know which is correct.
- Ambiguity - when a word or sentence has two different but possible meanings.
