## Week 1 Monday - Syllabus and Introduction

Course Structure
- Lectures will be recorded
- Quiz section is about being with a small group.
- If you miss quiz section, talk to your TA as soon as possible.
- There's a lot of technical work on the course.
- There are problem sets due every weekend. Succeed by practicing and going to course section.

Starting the course
```
{Premise}
1. All witches burn.
2. All wood burns.

{Conclusion}
Therefore,
3. Witches are made of wood.
```

- Premises are sets of claims. 
- Something will always follow from those premises.
- A conclusion is built from the premises.
- Two properties of arguments:
  - Valid: if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true
  - Invalid: not valid, the truth of the premises doesn't guarantee the truth of the conclusion
- Argument:
```
{Premise}
1. If she weighs the same as a duck, then she's made of wood.
2. If she's made of wood, then she's a witch.
3. She weighs the same as a duck.

{Conclusion}
Therefore,
4. She's a witch.
```
> This argument is valid. The premises logically lead to the conclusion. Good: it's valid. Bad: premises are false.
- We want arguments to be good both in validity and veracity of premises.

```
{Premise}
1. All humans are mortal.
2. Socrates is human.

{Conclusion}
Therefore,
3. Socrates is mortal.
```
> This argument is valid.

- Syllogism: two premises and a conclusion. At least one premise is a generalization.
- Soundness: valid argument *and* true premises. The gold standard of arguments.
  - The conclusion must be true.

```
{Premises}
1. All grudumps are lumps.
2. Mump is a grudump.

{Conclusion}
Therefore,
3. Mump is a lump.
```

- You can assess the validity of the argument without knowing the veracity of the premises *or what the premises even mean.*

**Schema/Form:**
1. All `A`s are `B`.
2. `n` is an `A`.
Therefore,
3. `n` is a `B`.

- Validity is a property of the *form* of an argument, rather than the argument itself.
- We can do logic with symbols even if we don't understand their meaning, or even if they don't mean anything!
- You cannot assess the validity of the premises, and therefore the soundness of the argument, without knowing what symbosl mean.
- Validity, however, is a formal argument.

```
{Premises}
1. Tom Cruise is a Martian.
Therefore,
2. Tom Cruise is a Martian.
```
- Circular reasoning - the premise is the same as the conclusion. Technically a valid argument, but not really quite meaningful. The argument could never persuade someone to believe the conclusion on the basis of the premise because the conclusion is the premise.
- Fallacy - tempting but problematic reasoning. Circular reasoning is a fallacy, but valid. 

```
{Premise}
1. There are 1 million tickets in the lottery.
2. Pia has one ticket.

{Conclusion}
Therefore,
3. Pia will not win.
```
- Two different types of logic:
  - *Deductive logic*: the study of deductive validity. If the prmeises are true, the conclusion must be true with 100% certainty.
  - *Inductive logic*: the study of probabilistic reasoning - if the premises are true, the conclusion is probably true.

*Why take this class?*
- The textbook is entirely online and free.
- The textbook is interactive. Textbook problems are no-stakes practice.
- Problem sets are Canvas quizzes. These can be taken 10 times.
  - Don't have too much pressure taking the quiz. Only your highest score will be kept.
  - The quiz will tell you how many you got wrong, but not which questions you got wrong.
- Exams are closed-book and closed-note.
- People always use logic, regardless of their discipline or career.
- You will always be using logic and subject to other people's logic.
