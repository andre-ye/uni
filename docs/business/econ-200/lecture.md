### What is Economics?
  - Economics is the study of *how people make choices as they try to attain their goals in a world of scarcity*.
  - Choices are made to attain a goal; purchases are made to promote our welfare in some way.'
    - However, we cannot purchase everything we want; we need to deal with this fact.
  - **Scarcity**: a situation in which unlimited wants exceed the limited resources available to fulfill those wants.
  - Economics is fundamentally studying how individuals - people or firms - make these decisions.
  - Economists use **economic models** can be sophisticated mathematical models based on simplified versions of reality.
    - Are used to analyze real-world situations.
    - Analyze: understand why choices are made and which situations/circumstances may need to change for individuals to make different choices.
    
#### Typical Economics Questions
  - We will answer questions like:
    - How are the prices of goods and services determined?
    - Why does the government control the prices of some goods and services, and what are the effects of those controls.
  - Economic tools can be applied to other decisions, too, like:
    - Why do people have so many or so few children?
    - How do people choose between hours spent working and hours spent relaxing?
  - Actual research of University of Washington Economists:
    - What is the effect of having a daughter on women's decision-making power?
    - How does the gender of school peers affect future outcomes?
    - What is the correct way to estimate air pollution?
  
#### Three Key Ideas
  People are rational.
  - **Rationality**: using all available information to achieve your goals.
  - Rational consumers and firms weigh the benefits and costs of each action and make the best decisions.
  - We try to understand benefits and costs, where they come from, and how they are calculated in the minds of individuals.
  - Rational individuals always use this information to make the best possible outcome - to make themselves as best off as possible.
  
  Optimal decisions involve calculating true costs and making marginal decisions.
  - **Opportunity cost**: the true cost of a choice is the value you *could have gained* by choosing the next-best alternative instead.
    - Not only the cost one may pay in terms of money, but the value forfeited by making one decision.
  - **Marginal cost and benefit** (MC and MB): the additional cost or benefit associated with a small amount extra of some action.
    - Not only the cost of the entire decision; what is the cost of making the *next choice*?
    - e.g. *I have come to class for the past two classes, what is the cost/benefit of attending the next class (not of attending 2 vs. 3 classes in total)?*
  - Comparing marginal cost and benefit is known as *marginal analysis*.
  
  People respond to incentives.
  - As tradeoffs change, so do the choices that individuals make.
  - Incentives can be positive or negative.
  - *Group lending* - if one member of your group defaults on a loan, no one can borrow from the bank.
    - Incentive to pressure other members of the group to pay loans.
    - Incentive to choose groups more likely to pay back their loans.
  
#### Economic Models
  - Economists develop economic models to analyze real-world issues.
  - Steps to building an economic model:
    1. Decide assumptions to use in developing the model;
    2. Formulate a testable hypothesis;
    3. Use economic data to test the hypothesis;
    4. Revise the model if it fails to explain the economic data well.
  - Important features of economic models:
    - Assumptions and simplifications
    - Testability
    - Economic variables
  
#### The Scientific Nature of Economics
  - When analyzing human behavior, we are using the scientific method.
  - We can perform:
    - *Positive analysis*: the study of "what is?"
    - *Normative analysis*: the study of "what ought to be?"
  - Normative analysis can be disguised as positive analysis - are you reading positive or normative analysis?
  - Economists generally try to perform **positive analysis**.
  
#### Microeconomics and Macroeconomics
  - **Microeconomics** is the study of
    - how households and firms make choices,
    - how they interact in markets,
    - how the government attempts to influence their choices
  - **Macroeconomics** is the study of the economy *as a whole*, including topics like inflation, unemployment, and economic growth.
  - There are many parallels between microeconomics and macroeconomics, but the difference lies in the analysis of the decisions of an individual or a government entity.
  
  
  
### Production Possibilities Frontier and Production
  
#### Production Possibilities Frontier
  - How do you decide how much of each type of good and service to produce in an economy?
  - Households, firms, and governments face decisions about how best to use scarce resources.
    - There is no unlimited amount of resources; resources need to be allocated into forms of production.
  - *Scarcity requires trade-offs*. Economics allows us to make good trade-offs.
  - A **production possibilities frontier (PPF)** is a curve showing maximum attainable combinations of two products that may be purchased with available resources and current technology.
  - Points *on* the PPF are attainable; points *below* the curve are inefficient (not purchasing the maximum production); points *above* the curve are unattainable with current resources.
  - **Opportunity cost**: the highest-valued alternative that must be given up to engage in an activity.
  
#### Concave PPFs
  - Linear PFPs suggest that the trade-offs between the two dimensions are always the same; opportunity cost rates remain constant.
  - Concave PFPs: as we produce more of a good, it becomes more expensive to produce. 
    - The opportunity cost of producing an additional unit of a good increase as more resources are allocated to its production.
  - It is also possible to have a *curved* PPF.
  - *The opportunity cost represents the suitability of the next input that is transferred from one production process to the other.*
  
#### Economic Growth on the PPF
  - You can measure economic growth with PPF.
  - The PFP should shift *outward* for all axes.
  - As more economic resources become available, the economy can shift outwards.
  - **Economic growth**: the ability of the economy to increase the production of goods and services.
  
#### Technological Change in One Industry
  - Some sort of technological advancement allows for the amount of output to increase for a particular input.
  - One axis remains unchanged, while the other expands.
  
#### Who Produces Which Goods and Why?
  - People around the globe coordinate production activities to sell to consumers what they want.
  - Figuring out how these decisions are made.
  - Global production is a natural outcome of people acting in their self-interest to improve their own lives.
  - *The invisible hand*: this coordination mechanism.
    - How we think about how market economics operates.
  
  
  
### Absolute and Comparative Advantage
  - The PPF is the key trade-off faced by an economy.
    - Need to think about the relative efficiency of each of the axes of the PPF.
  - Context of trade: if there is no trade between economies, then what a country produces is what it consumes.
    - Two countries agree on the exchange of goods.
    - If there is no trade, a country can only consume what it produces.
  - On the scale of the individual: you can only consume what you produce. 
  - With trade between individuals, you can create an abundance of a specialized good or service (more than you need for yourself) and use the excess to trade to others.
  - Using PPFs, we can understand how individuals decide what to produce and interact in a market economy.
  - **Absolute advantage**: when one individual can consistently produce more than another of a certain good.
    - Absolute advantage does not aid in understanding how individuals decide which goods to produce.
    - Trade is based instead on *opportunity cost*.
  - **Comparative advantage**: when an individual can produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than other individuals.
  - No country has a comparative advantage in everything, yet each country has a comparative advantage in producing something.
  
#### Why Specialize?
  - With specialization, given the trade-off nature of PPFs, more products can be produced net-wise.
  - There are many ways for which countries can come to a rational decision and be made better off with trade.
  - Ultimately, we study this not because we are interested in trade but because it is an analogy for how individuals make a trade.

### Why Trade?
  - In isolation, each country produces and consumes on its own.
  - If each country specializes by producing the good for which it has a comparative advantage, total production increases.
  - Gains from Trade: the improvement in outcomes that occurs when specialized producers exchange goods and services.
  - With specialized production, consumption is outside the PPF.
  - Specialization and trade can make everyone better off.
  - An economy is driven by individuals seeking to make a profit.
    - *People specialize to exploit comparative advantages.*
  
#### Considerations for Designing an Economy
  - What goods and services are produced? Firms/governments/individuals must decide this while considering trade-offs and opportunity costs.
  - How are goods and services produced? A firm might have several different ways to produce an item.
    - Which resources do we allocate and how?
  - Who will receive the goods and services? By income? By equity?
  
  
  
### Centrally Planned Economies
  - **Centrally planned economies**: governments decide what to produce, how to produce it, and who receives the goods and services.
  - **Market economies**: households and firms make decisions with prices and markets as the deciding force.
  - **Market**: a group of buyers and sellers of a good or service and the institution by which they come together to trade.
    - Market structure: how do firms interact with customers? What kind of relationship do they have?
  - Thinking about the cost of producing an item in terms of dollars; dollars represent what you *could have bought*.
  
  
  
### Markets
  - *Perfectly competitive market*:
    - Standardized good - goods are all the same; every seller is selling the same product
    - No transaction costs - there is no transactional cost in switching or purchasing a product.
    - Full information - you know everything there is to know about the product.
    - Participants are price takers - you don't have control over which price you buy at; you take the price.
  - Markets are assumed in this context to be perfectly competitive.
  
#### Efficiency of Economies
  Market economies promote:
  - Productive efficiency - goods or services are produced at the lowest possible cost.
  - Allocative efficiency - the marginal benefit of production is equal to its marginal cost.
  - Production is consistent with consumer preferences.
    - If people have a demand for something, a perfectly competitive economy will supply it.
  
#### Caveats About Market Economies
  Markets may not result in fully efficient outcomes:
  - Governments might interfere with market outcomes
  - Market outcomes may ignore the desires of people not involved in transactions
  
  Markets may result in high inequality.
  
  
  
### The Interaction of Demand and Supply
  - How do markets decide how much of a good or service to produce?
  
#### Demand Schedules and Quantity Demanded
  - To understand demand, we can understand something about the relationship between the price and the quantity demanded.
  - Price, in this case, is the *independent variable*.
  - Market demand - the demand by all the consumers of a given good or service.
  - *Ceteris paribus* - all variables except price and quantity are assumed to be held constant.
  - When we move *along* the demand curve, we are assuming *the law of demand*.
    - Ceteris paribus, when the price of a product falls, the quantity demanded of the product will increase.
    - Demand curves slope downward.
  
#### What Explains the Law of Demand?
  - When the price of a product falls, there are two effects:
    - **Substitution effect**: the product becomes cheaper relative to other groups, so consumers substitute toward it.
    - **Income effect**: the consumer has greater purchasing power and purchases more goods overall.
  ```
  Substitution effect + Income effect = Total change in quantity demanded due to a price change
  ```
  
  
  
### Increase and Decrease in Demand
  - A change in something *other than price* (violation of ceteris paribus): will induce a shift in demand.
  - As the demand curve shifts, the quantity demanded changes at every possible price.
  
#### Change in Income of Consumers
  - **Normal good**: a good for which demand increases as income increases.
  - **Inferior good**: a good for which the demand decreases as income rises.
  
#### Change in the Price of Related Goods
  - **Substitutes**: goods and services that can be used for the same purpose.
    - The price of substitutes is important in determining the price of a good.
    - When the price of a substitute goes up, demand for a good goes up.
  - **Complements**: goods and services that are used together. When the price of a complement goes up, demand for a good goes down.
  - Other sources of shifts: change in tastes, change in demographics
  
#### Change in Demand vs Change in Quantity Demanded
  - A change in the price of the product causes a movement along the demand curve.
    - *Change in quantity demanded*.
  - A change in a nonprice determinant causes the entire demand curve to shift.
    - *Change in demand*.

    * [Demand and Supply Both Count](#demand-and-supply-both-count)
    
  
  
### Supply Schedules and Supply Curves
  - **Supply curve**: shows the relationship between the price of a product and the quantity of the product supplied.
    - As the price goes up, producers want to supply more goods.
  - **Law of Supply**: ceteris paribus, increases in price cause increases in the quantity supplied.
    - Less strict than the law of demand, but generally applies.
    - Supply curves hence slope downward.
    
  
  
### Increase and Decrease in Supply
  - A change in something other than price that affects supply causes the *entire supply curve* to shift.
  - As the supply curve shifts, the quantity supplied will change, even if the price doesn't change.
  - The quantity supplied changes at every possible price.
  
#### Change in Prices of Inputs
  - *Inputs*: things used in the production of a good or service?
  - Increase in the price of the input decreases the profitability of selling the good, causing a decrease in supply.
  
#### Technological Change
  - A firm can experience positive or negative change to produce a given level of output with a given quantity of inputs.
    - *Technological change*.
  - The same number of inputs can produce more output, which means that more can be supplied for each price.
  - Changes raise or lower firms' costs and hence impact the quantity of the good supplied.
  
#### Prices of Substitutes and Number of Firms
  - Many firms can produce and sell more than one product.
  - More firms in the market will result in more products available at a given price - greater supply.
  
#### Change in Supply vs Change in Quantity Supplied
  - Change in quantity supplied: the price changes, and the quantity changes. Movement along the supply curve.
  - Change in supply: shifting the entire supply curve.
  
  
  
### Market Equilibrium Price and Quantity
  - The supply and demand curves intersect; this is the equilibrium point.
  - Equilibrium price and quantity derived from the equilibrium point.
  - Buyers and sellers want to trade the same quantity at the equilibrium price, so we do not expect the price to change.
  - **Surplus**: quantity supplied is greater than quantity demanded.
    - When there is a surplus, suppliers will lower the price to make more out of their supply.
  - **Shortage**: quantity demanded is greater than the quantity supplied.
    - When there is a shortage, suppliers will increase the price to make more out of their supply.
    - The people who benefit are randomly selected in a way (buyers who happen to get the good).
  - **Market equilibrium**: no tension, no shortage, or surplus.
    - A situation in which quantity demanded equals quantity supplied.
    - Perfectly competitive market equilibrium.
    
#### Demand and Supply Both Count
  - Price is determined by the intersection of buyers and sellers.
  - Neither group can dictate the price; all are price-takers, even though sellers contribute to the price.
  - Changes in supply and/or demand will affect the price and quantity traded.
    - Changes in the underlying position of the demand and supply curves (nonprice determinants).

### Curve Shifting and Changes in Equilibrium
  - We can predict the direction of an equilibrium change, but we don't know the magnitude.
  - Knowing the price responsiveness of producers and consumers can help us predict this.
  - Knowing something about the slope of the demand curve tells us about how things shift.
  
  
  
### Price Elasticity of Demand
  - Use percentage changes; lessens the impact of units.
  - The price elasticity of demand is a negative number; negative elasticities are "larger" or "higher", "more elastic".
     - More responsive to price.
  
#### Price Elasticity of Demand Terminology
   - "Large value" means that quantity changes a lot in response to a price change.
   - "Small value" means that consumers are less responsive.
   - *Price elastic* - price elasticity is larger than 1.
   - *Price elastic* - price elasticity is less than 1.
   - A vertical demand curve means that quantity demanded does not change as price changes. *Perfectly inelastic*; elasticity is zero.
   - A horizontal demand curve means that the quantity demanded is infinitely responsive to price changes. *Perfectly elastic*; elasticity is infinite.
  
#### Percentage Changes and the Midpoint Formula
   - Percent change from *A* to *B* is different from the percent change from *B* to *A*.
   - Midpoint formula avoids the confusion of whether we are going from *A* to *B* or from *B* to *A*.
  
  
  
### Determinants of Price Elasticity of Demand
  - **Availability of close substitutes** - a product with more substitutes has a higher elasticity of demand.
  - **Passage of time** - over time, people adjust their buying habits. Elasticity is higher in the long run than in the short run.
  - **Luxury or necessity good** - people are more flexible with luxuries than necessities, so the price elasticity of demand is higher for luxuries.
  - **Definition of the market** - the more narrowly defined the market, the more substitutes are available, and hence demand is more elastic.
  - **Share of the good in the consumer's budget** - if a good is a small portion of your budget, you will likely not be very sensitive to its price.
  
  
  
### Elasticity and the Pricing Decision
  - How do businesses take into account elasticity?
  - What will happen to my total revenue if I cut my price?
  - If demand for your product is price inelastic, decreasing the price gains only a few customers. Total revenue goes down.
  - If demand for your product is price elastic, decreasing the price gains many few customers. Total revenue should increase.
  - Change between the price effect and the quantity effect.
  
  
  
### Price Elasticity of Supply
  - Similar to how we think about price elasticity of supply.
  - *Price elasticity of supply* measures producers' response to a change in price.
  - Price elasticity of supply is always positive.
  
#### Determinants of Price Elasticity of Supply
  - Availability of inputs.
  - Flexibility of the production process.
  - Adjustment time.
  
  
  
### Cross Price Elasticity of Demand
  - If the price of an alternative/substitute good changes, then demand for a good changes.
  - A measure of how the quantity demanded of one good changes when the price of different good changes.
  - The midpoint formula calculates elasticity between the quantity demanded of good A and the price of good B.
  - Cross-price elasticity of demand can be positive or negative.
  - If the cross-price elasticity of demand is positive, the two goods are substitutes. If they are negative, they are complements.
  
  
  
### Income Elasticity of Demand
  - A measure of how much quantity demanded changes in response to a change in consumer incomes.
  - If the income elasticity of demand is:
     - larger than 0 but less than 1, it is a normal good.
     - larger than 1, it is a luxury.
     - less than 0, it is inferior.

### Introduction
  - The market sets a price. Are we happy with that? Should society intervene?
  - Society may intervene when the market outcome is not equitable or when it fails.
  - We can understand the consequences of government intervention by returning to efficiency and a new concept - surplus.
  
  
  
### Consumer and Producer Surplus
  - Something that remains above what is used or needed. NOt the same as excess supply.
  - What is left over after the buyer or seller makes a transaction.
  - *Consumer surplus* - the difference between the highest price a consumer is willing to pay and the actual price the consumer pays.
  - *Producer surplus* - the difference between the lowest price a firm is willing to accept and the price it receives.
  
  
  
### Consumer Surplus
  - How much is a consumer willing to pay? (WTP)
  - Maximum price a consumer is willing to pay or a marginal good: the marginal benefit of that good.
  - Demand curve: marginal benefit curve.
  - Depends on the price and marginal benefit - consumer's additional benefit from consuming one more unit of a good or service.
  
  
  
### Producer Surplus
  - Difference between the lowest price a firm would accept and the price it receives.
  - What is the lowest price a firm would accept for a good or service?
    - *The marginal cost*: the additional cost of producing one more unit.
  
  
  
### What Consumer and Producer Surplus Measure
  - Consumer surplus: net benefit to consumers from participating in the market, rather than a total benefit.
  - Producer surplus: net benefit to producers from participating in the market.
  
  
  
### Surplus and Economic Efficiency
  - Definitions of economic efficiency:
    1. A market is efficient if the marginal benefit equals or exceeds the marginal costs for all trades.
    2. A market is efficient if it maximizes the sum of consumer and producer surplus. Known as economic surplus, or total welfare.
  
  
  
### The Efficiency of Competitive Equilibrium
  - Demand: marginal benefit of each good unit.
  - Supply: the marginal cost of each good unit.
  - Only at the competitive equilibrium is the last unit valued by consumers and producers equally. Economic efficiency.
  - At the competitive equilibrium quantity, the economic surplus is also maximized.
  - Our two concepts of economic efficiency result in the same levels of output.
  - **Deadweight loss** (DWL): the amount of inefficiency in a market. IN a competitive equilibrium, deadweight loss is zero.

### Market Equilibrium and Efficiency
  - The market equilibrium maximizes the total well-being (surplus) of all participants in the market.
  - Prices above and below the market equilibrium decrease the total surplus
  
  
  
  
### Changing the Distribution of Total Surplus
  - Surplus is transferred between consumers and producers when an artificial price is imposed.
  
  
  
  
### Deadweight Loss
  - Occurs between what a perfectly competitive market output would be and the actual output; transactions that no longer take place.
  - Reduces consumer and producer surplus.
  
  
  
  
### Why Intervene?
  - Correcting market failures or misset markets.
    - Market failures: the market is not producing efficiently.
  - Changing the distribution of benefits.
  - Encouraging or discouraging consumption of certain goods.

  - Price ceiling: maximum legal price a good can be sold. Usually placed on essential goods and services.
  - Price floor: minimum legal price a good can be sold. Usually placed on agricultural goods risky to produce.
  
#### Price Ceilings
  - The price ceiling is below the equilibrium price for it to be effective.
  - Producers supply a lower quantity. Consumers demand a higher quantity.
  - Excess demand, shortage.
  - Welfare effects: analyze how surplus changes.
  - Are price ceilings worth the decrease in total surplus?
  - Goods must be rationed; how? Equally? First-come first serve? Preference/corruption?
  - Shortages cause people to engage in rent-seeking behavior, like bribing whoever is in charge of allocating scarce supplies.
  
#### Price Floors
  - For it to be effective, the price floor must be imposed above the equilibrium price.
  - Excess supply.
  - The government can buy the excess supply.
  - How does the price floor affect welfare?
  - How much excess milk will the government buy?
    - The government must buy the excess supply created by the price floor.
  - Ignore the welfare impact of the excess amount being purchased - we don't know what is happening with it.
  
  
  
### Price Incentives
  - Taxes: buyer or seller must pay some extra amount to the government on top of the sale price.
  - Subsidy: buyer or seller receives payment from the government that lowers sale price.
  
#### Taxes
  - A tax will reduce consumption and provide a source of revenue.
  
  Tax on the supplier
  - You shift the supply curve; the willingness to sell is $$n$$ and the willingness to buy is $$n+t$$.
    - $$t$$: tax imposed.
  - Tax wedge: the difference between the equilibrium price of the shifted supply curve and demand curve and the price for the same quantity supplied on the "unshifted" supply curve.
  - Tax Revenue: $$\text{quantity sold} \times \text{tax wedge}$$.
  - Total surplus lost is the tax revenue plus the deadweight loss.
  
  Tax on the buyer
  - The demand curve shifts down/left.
  - The tax wedge and the new equilibrium is the same.
  - Impositions of the tax on the supplier and the buyer have the same effect.
  
  Tax incidence
  - Who will bear the burden?
  - What matters is the relative elasticities.
  - Whichever side of the market is **more price elastic** will shoulder **less** of the burden.
  - The burden of the tax (price change) is the person with the more or less elastic supply or demand.
  
  Welfare effects of a tax
  - Both buyers and suppliers lose surplus.
  - Lost surplus goes to the government and deadweight loss.
  
### Subsidies
  - Subsidies have two primary effects: encourage production and consumption, provides money to producers and buyers.
  - The incidence of the subsidy is not determined by who the subsidy goes to.
  
  Subsidy for the supplier
  - The supply curve shifts down/right by the equilibrium.
  - Buyers pay a lower amount, suppliers receive a higher amount.
  - Subsidy causes overproduction; there is an area where the marginal cost of production increases and the marginal benefit declines. This is an area of negative surplus.
    - Overproduction causes welfare loss.
  
  Government expenditures from subsidy
  $$\text{GE} = \text{Subsidy} \times Q_\text{post-subsidy}$$
  - Producers and consumers gain surplus because they are producing and consuming more, respectively.
  
  
  
### Effect of a Tax or Subsidy
  - We can predict the effect on equilibrium quantity if the price elasticity of supply and demand are known.
  - The more elastic the supply or demand, the greater the change in equilibrium quantity.
  
#### Long-Run Versus Short-Run Impact
  - In the long run, the elasticity increases.
  - Buyers and sellers take time to respond to changes in price; the full effect of price controls becomes clear only in the long run.

### Why trade? A Review
  - With specialization and trade, they can coordinate their production and produce more goods.
  - Importing and exporting.
  - We would expect many countries to produce many goods.
  
  
  
### The Roots of Comparative Advantage
  - Firms produce goods and services for which they have a comparative advantage.
  - Characteristics that affect the cost of production are:
    - Technology
    - Factor endowment (does it have a lot of a certain type of worker or capital)
    - Natural resources and climate
  
  
  
### From Autarky to Free Trade
  - *Autarky* - an economy that is self-contained and does not engage in trade.
  - If people want to buy t-shirts, they no longer need to buy them from domestic suppliers.
  - If the world price is less than the autarky domestic price, domestic buyers will buy at the world price.
    - Domestic price decreases to equal the world price.
    - Excess demand occurs; imports fill the excess.
  - If the world price is larger than the autarky domestic price, domestic sellers will sell at the world price.
    - Excess supply occurs; exports fill the excess.
  - Consumer and producer surpluses are affected.
  
  
  
### International Labor and Capital
  - Free demand increases demand for factors of production that are domestically abundant and increases the supply of domestically sparse factors.
  - Owners of domestically scarce resources suffer from trade liberalization.
  
  
  
### Government Policies in Restriction of Trade
  - **Tariffs**: a tax imposed by a government on goods imported into a country.
  - **Quotas (Voluntary Export Restraints)**: limits imposed upon countries on the quantity of a good imported by one country from another. The government doesn't get any tax money.
  
#### Tariffs
  - Tax targeted at certain imports.
  - Purpose: reduce the number of imports to protect domestic producers.
  - World price: technically world *supply curve*. It is perfectly flat (elastic).
  - Tariffs increase the world price for domestic consumers and decrease the amount of shortage made up by imports.
  - Domestic welfare effects: producers gain surplus, governments raise revenue, deadweight loss is generated, and consumers lose surplus.
  
### Quotas
  - Quota: a limit on how much of a good can be imported.
  - Quota rents: profits earned by foreign firms or governments under a quota.
  - Effects of a quota:
    - Decreases imports
    - Increases import price
    - Increases producer surplus
    - Decreases consumer surplus
    - Generates quota rents for foreign entities.
    - Deadweight loss is generated.

### Externalities
  - **Private costs**: firms make decisions about how to produce based on these; they are paying these themself.
  - **Social cost**: a cost that exists as a byproduct of the production. Not considered in private costs, but is felt by society.
  - Firms produce according to their **marginal private cost**; consumers purchase according to their **marginal private benefit**.
  - The **social cost** includes both the private and external cost of pollution.
  - **Externality**: a benefit or cost that affects someone not involved in the trade of a good.
    - Choices made by firms and consumers are not **allocatively** efficient. 
  - The optimal level of production is where the marginal cost to society is equal to the marginal benefit.
  
  
  
### Market Failure
  - When there are unconsidered externalities, the market equilibrium will not be efficient; there will be a deadweight loss.
  - **Market failure**: the market fails to produce an efficient level of output.
    - Have externalities been taken into consideration?
  
#### Inefficiency Due to Negative Externalities
  - The market price is too low, the market quantity is too high. There is too much market production.
  - The cost to society exceeds the benefit to society; too much of the good is produced, and deadweight loss is produced.
  
#### Inefficiency Due to Positive Externalities
  - Positive externalities result in underproduction.
  - The true benefit has not been realized, and thus deadweight loss is generated.
  
  
  
### What Causes Externalities?
  - Externalities arise because of incomplete property rights, or from difficulty enforcing property rights.
  - Deadweight loss from pollution can be reduced if property rights allow for parties to come to a mutually beneficial trade and increase surplus.
  
  
  
### The Coase Theorem
  - Private parties can solve an externality problem given ownership rights to arrive at a socially efficient output through private bargaining.
    - Transaction costs must be low and property rights are assigned & enforceable.
    - Parties must have full information about costs and benefits.
  - It does not matter *who* gets the property rights, for efficiency's sake.
    - The owner of the property rights will benefit more, but this does not alter the efficiency.
    
  
  
### Pigovian or Corrective Taxes for Negative Externalities
  - *Internality*: a cost placed on individual publishes.
  - What is a situation in which the consumption of goods can be shifted.
  - Taxes caused inefficiency, but Pigovian taxes that capture negative externalities return to an increased level of efficiency.
  - A tax is applied to move the private marginal demand or cost curve towards the social marginal demand or cost curve.
  - Consumers pay the efficient price, while producers receive the efficient price minus the tax.
  - Pigovian taxes are popular because they increase efficiency while bringing in tax revenue; they bring a double dividend of taxation.
  
  
  
### Corrective Subsidies for Positive Externalities
  - We can subsidize curves; producers receive the efficient price and consumers pay the efficient price minus the subsidy.
  
  
  
  
### Other Public Solutions
  - Quotas can counteract inefficiently high consumption but don't always maximize surplus.
  - Quotas can be improved via tradable allowances, in which quota allowances can be bought and sold.
    - The market quantity is socially optimal, and total surplus is maximal.
  - Tradable allowance does not create any government revenue.

### The Costs of Production
  - The basic activity of a firm is to use *inputs*, like workers, machines, and natural resources to produce *outputs* of goods and services.
  - This process - turning inputs into outputs - is called **technology**.
  - Improvement in the ability to turn inputs into outputs is a positive **technological change**.
  - A firm's good is to maximize profits.
  - **Total revenue**: the amount a firm receives from the sale of goods and services.
  - **Total cost**: the amount a firm pays for inputs used to produce goods or services.
  
#### The Short and the Long Run in Economics
  - **Short-run** - period of time in which at least one of a firm's inputs is fixed.
  - Inputs are often simplified as labor and capital.
  - In the **long run**, no inputs are fixed, and the firm can adopt new technology.
  
#### Fixed and Variable Costs
  - **Variable costs**: costs that change as output changes.
  - **Fixed costs**: costs that remain constant as output changes.
  - In the long run, all the firm's costs are variable.
  - **Total cost**; the sum of variable costs and fixed costs.
  
#### Explicit and Implicit Costs
  - Economists like to consider all the opportunity costs of an activity (both explicit and implicit costs).
  - **Explicit cost**: A post involving spending money
    - Usually easier to identify.
  - **Implicit cost**: A non-monetary opportunity cost
    - Composed of forgone opportunities that could have generated revenue.
  
#### Economic and Accounting Profit
  - Accounting profit: total revenue minus explicit costs.
  - Economic profit: total revenue minus explicit costs and implicit costs.
  
  
  
### Production
  - **Marginal product**: the increase in output generated by an additional unit of input.
  - **Principle of marginal product**: marginal product of input decreases as the quantity of the input increases.
  - **Average product**: total production divided by the number of workers.
  - Marginal and Average Product are defined relative to some input, ceteris paribus.
  
#### Average Product of Labor
  - Average of the marginal products of labor.
  
#### Marginal Product of Labor
  - Marginal product curve passes through the maximum of the average product curve.
  
#### Graphs of Output and Marginal Product of Labor
  - The output curve flattens out and the marginal product curve decreases because of the principle of diminishing returns.

### Marginal Costs of Production
  - **Marginal cost**: change in firm's total cost from producing one more unit of a good or service.
  - Can be rewritten as wage divided by marginal product labor (assuming the wage stays the same).
  
#### Graphing Average and Marginal Costs
  - Since the average cost of production follows the marginal post down and up, it forms a U-shaped curve.
  
#### Observations About Costs
  - Average Total Cost is the sum of Average Fixed Cost and Average Variable Cost.
  - When the Marginal Cost is above the Average Total Cost, it is rising.
  - The Marginal Cost curve cuts through the ATC and AVC at their minimum point.
  - The ATC is the vertical sum of AVC and AFC curves.
  
  
  
  
### The Long Run and Average Costs
  - **Long run average cost curve** - lowest cost at which a firm can produce a given quantity of output in the long run, in which no inputs are fixed.
  - Think about long-run cost curves as an agglomeration of short-run total cost curves.
  - As a firm moves to larger quantities, they experience **economies of scales**.
    - The ability not only to vary the *number of workers* but also technology (size of factories, machines, etc.)
  - Constant returns to scale: flat region of the long-run average cost.
  - **Minimum efficient scale**: lowest level of output at which all economies of scale are exhausted.
  - Eventually, firms get so large they experience **diseconomies of scale**.

### Market Structures
  Market Structures: models of how firms in a market interact with buyers to sell their output.
  - Perfectly competitive markets
  - monopolistically competitive markets
  - Oligopolies
  - Monopolies
  
  
  
### Introduction to Perfectly Competitive Markets
  - A perfectly competitive market has
    - Many buyers and sellers
    - Identical products sold
    - No barriers to new firms entering the market
  - Competitive firms are price-takers (unable to affect market price)
  
#### The Demand Curve for a Perfectly Competitive Firm
  - A perfectly competitive firm is too small to affect the market price no matter what quantity is sold.
  - An individual can sell any amount they want at any price. They do not need to lower the price to sell more.
  
#### How Is the Firm's Demand Curve Determined
  - Collective supply determines the market price, but the individual takes a flat demand curve.
  
#### Firm Revenue in PC Markets
  - For perfectly competitive firms, price equals average revenue equals marginal revenue.
  
#### Profit Maximization: The Goal of the Firm
  - Why don't all firms sell an infinite quantity?
  - Firms don't care about revenue, but instead profit.
  - The cost curve is nonlinear.
  - Firms choose an output that maximizes profit.
  - Quantity at which we maximize profit is when marginal revenue equals marginal cost.
  
#### Rules for Profit Maximization
  1. Profit-maximizing level of output is where the difference between total revenue and the total cost is the greatest.
  2. Profit maximizing level of output is where MR = MC.
  3. These are true for every firm.
  4. For PC firms, P=MR, meaning that profit-maximizing level of output is also when P = MC.
  
  
  
### A Useful Formula for Profit
  - Average profit = Price - ATC.
  - Profit = $$(P - ATC) \times Q$$.
  - Rectangle of length $$Q$$ and height $$P - ATC$$.

### Short Run Responses to Perfectly Competitive Firms to Losses
  - A firm in a perfectly competitive market making a loss has two options:
    1. Continue to produce
    2. Stop production by shutting down temporarily
  - If the firm shuts down, it still needs to pay for fixed costs.
    - These are *sunk costs* - nothing the firm can do about it.
  - Look at variable costs. Profit is (price minus AVC minus AFC) times quantity.
    - Pull out: Profit is (price minus AVC) times quantity minus FC.
  - If profit is negative and the price is larger than the variable cost, profit is still higher than -FC. Production should continue to minimize losses.
  - The firm's shut down decision is based on its variable costs.
  - The marginal cost is the short-run market supply curve.
  
  
  
### The Effects of Entry on Economic Profit
  - Firms can leave the market in the long run if they are not making a positive profit in the long run.
  - When firms make positive profits, other firms enter the market to benefit from positive profits. The supply curve shifts until the marginal firm make no profit.
  
  
  
### The Effects of Economic Losses
  - Long-run equilibrium price occurs at the minimum of the ATC curve.
    - Intersection of demand and supply curves.
  - When demand decreases, economic profit becomes negative, and firms exit.
  - Supply falls again; the price rises again back to the break-even equilibrium price.
  
  
  
### Long-Run Supply
  - Long-run market supply curve located at the minimum point on the ATC curve, is flat.
  - Firms will adjust; in the long run, the supply curve is flat.
  - Increasing cost industry: some factor of production cannot be replicated (e.g. natural resources)
  - Decreasing cost industry: additional firms generate profits for existing firms.
  
  
  
### Types of Efficiency
  - **Productive efficiency** - a situation in which a good or service is produced at the lowest possible cost.
  - **Allocative efficiency** - every good or service is produced up to the point where the last unit provides a marginal benefit equal to the marginal cost.
  - Perfectly competitive markets are both productively and allocatively efficient.
  - Perfectly competitive markets are useful benchmarks.

### What is a Monopoly?
  - A monopoly is a market with only one firm that is the only seller of a good or service w/out a close substitute.
    - The "antithesis" of perfect competition.
  - Some firms are monopolists; firms can also collude to act as a monopolist; give insight into the most extreme case of market power.
  - Some firms may have *monopoly power* to raise prices and obtain positive economic profits, even if they are not perfect monopolies.
  
#### Why do Monopolies Exist?
  - Monopolies exist because of barriers to entry that prevent other firms from entering the market.
    - Scarce resources: there are not enough resources for new firms.
    - Economies of scale: natural monopoly, long-run costs are lower for higher levels of output.
    - Government intervention: patent, copyright, for instance.
    - Aggressive business tactics: drive out competition, price changing.
    
  
  
### Monopolies and the Demand Curve
  - Monopolists are beholden to the demand curve.
  - Monopolies must look at the demand curve and make choices as to how to choose the price.
  
#### Monopoly Revenue
  - When a monopolist produces more of a good, the market price is driven down.
  - Producing an additional unit of output has two effects on total revenue:
    - Quantity effect
    - Price effect
  - Total revenue can increase or decrease, depending on which effect is larger.
  - To maximize profit, monopolies produce at the point where $$MC = MR$$.
  - Total revenue is maximized when $$MR = 0$$.
  - $$AR = P$$, average revenue, and price are greater than marginal revenue.
  
#### Profit-Maximizing Price and Output for a Monopoly
  - $$MC = MR$$ determines quantity for a monopolist.
  - No distinction between the short run and long run for monopoly, except for lower costs.
  - Monopolists continue to earn profits in the long run.
  
  
  
### Comparing Monopoly and Perfect Competition
  - Marginal revenue is always less than price; the price must be greater than marginal cost.
  - There will be deadweight loss and the market will not be efficient.
  - Monopolies sell at a lower quantity and higher price than perfect competition.
  
  
  
### Measuring the Efficiency Losses from Monopoly
  - Consumer surplus will fall, producer surplus will rise.
  - Can an increase in producer surplus offset the decrease in consumer surplus? - No. The quantity decreases.
  - Many firms have market power - the ability of a firm to charge a price greater than marginal cost.

### Monopolistic Competition
  - A market with many firms that sell similar but differentiated goods and services.
    - Able to earn a positive profit in the short run by selling a differentiated product.
    - Offer goods that are similar to competitors' products but more attractive.
  - Advertising and branding - a manifestation of product differentiation.
  - Each firm forms its own market and thus is able to operate like a 'small' monopoly.
  
#### Demand Curve for a Monopolistically Competitive Firm
  - Face a downward sloping demand curve that is not very steep; pretty elastic because consumers can switch to other firms, are pretty price-sensitive.
  - Firm has to lower the price to sell more goods.
  
#### How a Price Cut Affects Firm Revenue
  - When the price decreases, the revenue increases by the quantity effect but decreases by the price effect.
  - Marginal revenue is less than price.
  
#### Demand and Marginal Curves
  - The point at which marginal revenue equals zero is the revenue-maximization location.
  
#### Profit Maximization
  - Occurs where marginal cost equals marginal revenue.
  - Profit is assumed to be larger than zero because of product differentiation.
  
  
  
### Long Run Profits
  
#### Product Differentiation in the Long Run
  - In the short run, firms can make a positive profit.
  - In the long run, firms can enter the market and 'threaten' product differentiation.
  
#### How the Entry of New Firms Affects Profits of Existing Firms
  - Substitutes for the firm's good increase
  - Demand falls and becomes more elastic for any one firm
  - In the long run, no profit can be made, so price equals ATC (demand tangent to ATC).
    - As more firms enter, existing firms are driven to zero profit.
  
#### Short Run Firms Making Loss
  - When firms make a loss, there is no quantity at which demand (price) is above ATC, and thus the firm makes a short-run economic loss.
  - In the long run, firms exit, and price rises again to where the demand curve is tangent to ATC.
  - In the long run, the firm must break even.
  - The firm can, at best, produce at the quantity where the ATC curve is tangent to the demand curve.
  
#### Zero Profit in the Long Run
  - **Brand management**: convince customers that the product/experience is better than other firms. Intended to maintain product differentiation, keep the demand curve downward-sloping.
  - Innovate so costs are lower than that of other firms.
  - Firms do not passively affect the long-run outcome.
  
  
  
### The Efficiency of Monopolistic Competition
  - Monopolistic competition is neither productively nor allocatively efficient.
  - When the demand curve is flat, it can touch ATC at the lowest point.
  - When the price is equal to ATC in monopolistic competition, the demand curve is sloped and therefore not productively efficient. Always produces less than is efficient.
  
  
  
### Monopolistic Competition and Welfare
  - Monopolsiitcally competitive firms maximize profits by setting prices larger to marginal cost, leading to deadweight loss.
  - Entry can drive monopolistically competitive firms to zero profit in the long run, but markets will still produce a deadweight loss.
  - Firms operate at a smaller-than-efficient scale.
