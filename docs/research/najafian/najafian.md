I work on building deep learning models for the semantic segmentation of cell features. With my project manager, David Smerkous, we have developed a host of interesting and successful deep learning modeling techniques. I have been working on the [Foot Process Width Segmentation in Podocytes project](https://andre-ye.github.io/docs/projects/slit-detection/).

> We will be presenting at the UW Undergrad Research Symposium.
