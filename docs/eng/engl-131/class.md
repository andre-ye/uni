## Week 1 Thursday

| 3.7 | 0 | 0 |
| 3.0 | 1 | 0 |
| 2.0 | 2 | 0 |
| 1.0 | 3+ | 0 |

- *Extra labor* - additional effort to contribute towards your growth outside of class assignments to contriubte to your growth as a thinker and writer.
- Soft deadlines; deadlines exist, but are slightly flexible. Assignments are due Sundays at 11:59 PM.

*Why is the course structured as it is?*
- Grades tend to disproportionately punish people who are already marginalized or struggling in other ways.
- Grades do not accurately communicate learning or writing quality.
- Other aspects that grades usually cover are highly subjective.
- Subjective grades affect how you interact with instructors.
