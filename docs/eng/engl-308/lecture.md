## Week 1 Tuesday - Syllabus and Course Introduction
- Today - give an overview of what will be happening in the quarter.
- Not an easy class. If it's not for you, don't take it.
- History of the class
  - Taught over 20 years
  - Marxism taught trhough the backdoor
  - Marxism needed to be integrated into the department
  - Argued to be the most central couruse for English majors
  - 2008 financial crisis - important to understand this.
  - In 2008, lobbied to put the course on the books. Became a listed English course.
  - At certain times, there has been a certain amount of anxiety. Rides different waves of politics. There is always a waitlist about the class.
  - The conservative backlash. 
  - Marxist theory as central to life in the 21st century.
  - *Corona Capitalism* - crisis has revealed disparities in wealth and resources in truly profound ways.
- The course is principally an examination of a Marxist approach to analysis of culture and literature. Not necessarily as a political philosophy. As a critical/naalytical framework. Not Marxism as a political philosophy,, but talking about Marxism as a critical/analytical framework.
- Way of thinking about power as it manifests in culture and literature - impacted by forces of power, including the capitalist system as it racializes, sexualizes, genders, and creates identity.
- Political philosophy grounded in an analyssi of economics and history. How to get from economics and history to culture and literature. There are Marxist scholars in every discipline. How do they turn a theory of economics and history into a theory of literature and culture?
- Marx was a bit of a polymath, reading very broadly in emergent subjects.
- Boils down to a historical shift; we've moved incrementally into a present moment from an analysis of literature as aesthetic, beautiful, artistic, pertaining to universal truths/values - to an understanding of literature as social, historical, and full of power and contestation.
- All teachers - whether they announce themselves as Marxists or not - have been influenced by Marxist teachings, which have saturated the Academy.
- New Criticism. Puts together a version of literary scholarship focused on the aesthetic, form, and questions of beauty. Nnot interested in questions of power and politics. 
- Brings about an approach to culture expressed in power dynamics in class, culture, race, gender, sexuality.
- Important to recognize different modalities of power. Can be reified as identities. Categorization, division, hierarchization. Nothing natural about modalities; imposed to make capitalism go.
- Racism, sexism, homophobia, and capitalism - the isms, the systems of power. Race, gender, sexuality, class. -isms intersect. The language of intersectionality is a celebrated language.
- Weinbaum argues that feminism, CRTS, post-colonial studies, sexuality studies, cultural studies, etc. - modes of inquiry only possible because of Marxism. They are not merely derivative - the very idea of studying power comes from Marxism.
- You can't have feminist without Marxism; you can't have anti-racist theory without Marxism, etc.
- Intellectual history of Marxism is the influential framework that allows for thes eother theories to emerge. 
- (No breaks, and no powerpoints. Post-break discussion usually lags. Usually we roll for as long as possible, then conclude discussion.)
- Kimberle Crenshaw, responsible for creating the bogeyman CRT and intersectionality.
- Checking out - is there a way in which Staurt Hall - 'race is the modality in which class is lived'. Intersectional formulation. People wer ealready beginning to think through connections.
- Is there a natural affinity between capitalism and racism? Does capitalism need racism in order to go?
- Is there a natural affinity between sexism and homophobia?
- What are the hierarchies of power that have needed to be set inplace for capitalism to sustain itself?
- A Marxist approach empahsizes that there are material constraints that produce social, political, and economic power relationships and thus the hierarchy of race, gender, class. Bound up with capitalism. This changes the way we study literature.
- Marxism brings hierarchical orderings of power into focus.
- No one debate you that we live in a capitalist world system. No part of this planet has not been impacted by capitalist modernity.
- Marxism is the only and principal method to understand capitalism - and it's the only course in the UW. What does it tell you about capitalism?
- Why is it that the one philosophy develpoped over a century is not taught in every classroom, because we live in a capitalist world.
- Main argument: Marxism is the principal tool for understanding the capitalist system we live in. 
  - To not teach it is an 'insanity'
- What does this history mean for students of English and culture more broadly?
- Cultural Studies - intellectual formation that began in Britain and arrived to the US. Applying Marxist theory to culture, disseminates through teh Academy, inflitrates New Criticism
- Marxism is the post powerful method for interpreting the dominant culture.
- Marxist theory steps away from it. It's not an endorser. It sees systems from the outside. Marxist theory suggests there is nothing natural about capitalism, and that it is an invention.
- What does it mean to look at capitallist systems from a distance. 
- Culture has a complex relationship with capitalism.
- Culture supports and contests capitalism. 
- Most culture doesn't think explicitly in terms of capitalism. How does it exist within the capitalist ecosystem? Nothing is neutral, it is always political. There is nothing neutral. 
- Mediation - how does culture mediate capitalism? Different theories of mediation.
- "We are living in conservative times"
- Nancy Hartsock and standpoint epistemology
- The Academy exists within the capitalist world and to some extent accomodates the capitalist system.
- Four reasons why Marxist literary theory is the best tool for understanding life today and for understanding literature and culture today.
  1. Marxism has become more, or not less, relevant in the lsat 200 years since the period of its invention. We are living in Marx and Engels's predictions for the future. In some ways, Marx's conflicts, differences, etc. was visible in Marxist times (think - Dickens), but today capitalism is not merely a European phenomenon. We are living now in late capitalism, or an entrenched capitalism in which capitalist logics and ways of being saturate every being of our life.
    - Neoliberalism - an ideology of late capitlaism suggesting the market values of being should be how we exist in the world.
    - The market as not something to be contested but rather to be embraced
    - 'Express love with a diamond ring' - how do we get o a formulation from that. How do commodities and the purchasing of things become an expression of worth and human value?
  2. We become more global - literally. We live in a global world. Marx teaches us that *people* make history - not kings or presidents, but rather masses, collectivites, the Proletariat - constnatly engaged in struggle and the world in which we share.
    - Neither the coronavirus nor culture obey political lines.
    - Which culture dominates, which culture rises to the top?
    - Some say that American culture is global culture. 
    - How does this speak to the situation of America? Flows go in multiple directions
    - Modern femininity emerged simultaneously across the world. Had to do with the global flow of commodities - clothing, lipstick, skin lighteners, tampons, etc. Creating modern versions of feminity. These modern flows came from Japan and China to the rest of the world, rather than vice versa.
    - Literature represents a global world. This global culture is not always on the side of the ruling class.
    - Culture is a site of conflict. Marx would say that it is a site of class conflict. Marxist theory allows us to understand this, to percieve the struggle and conflict in culture. Trying to parse or interpret culture is itself a political act. To not see culture as a political entity is to erase its participation in power relationships. How does power emenate from 'universal values' or aesthetics?
    - Universal values as a capitalist ruse
    - Marx suggested that the point is not merely to interpret the world, but to change it. The difference between a Marxist scholar and a scholar informed by Marxism. 
  3. Marxist theory makes us conscious about political and economic lens. You will never write a paper the same again.
  4. We will be able to traverse from theories of economics and politics to a theory of literature.

**Syllabus.**
- Marxist theory is a huge iceberg. A large body of work by Marx and Engels.
- Marx & Engels wrote 50 volumes of writing - a massive body of work. 9 volumes are the collected letters. Other 41 volumes are published and unpublished works.
- Marxism gets taken up by people all over the world. Many philosophers decide to build upon Marx and Engel's work, as well as political actors - Lenin, Mao, etc. Althusser, Angela Davis.
- We are not debating experiments in communism - Soviet Union, North Korea, etc. Not about the political philosophy, but rather the critical methods that can be derived from those courses. Political questions are for political science courses.
- Many Marxists didn't give any attention to literature and culture.
- There is on universal Marxist orthodoxy, but rather a range of experiments. Vast body of philosophy that can teach us a lot.
- You want the translator Samuel Moore - this was the translation that Marx and Engels approved. 
- First reader response - you can't think without writing. Due on Monday of Week 2. 
- Two classes of the Communist Manifesto, then turning to Theses Concerning Feuerbach
- From capital to ideology - a thought system that works in certain ways to aid and abet systems of power. A theory of ideology is a theory of mediation. 
- Responses must be 750 or 1000 words, exactly. Writing and concision.
- Partial grade contract course. You are living up to a standard of deep engagement. All your papers must be at the standard of deep engagement. 
- The instructor will grade if it is meeting the standard or not on three responses.
- 7 responses for a 3.8 to 4.0. 
- You must complete responses 3, 5, 7.
- All responses must respond to the prompt.

## Week 1 Thursday - Parts I and II of *The Communist Manifesto*
- Naomi Klein, *Corona Capitalism* - much has happened in the past few years. It reads differently in retrospect.
  - The *Manifesto* is about crises, recurring crises - crises veer off into new directions, new ideas and eras, revolutions. Hurculean jumps are possible in crises.
  - The Pandemic was thought to maybe be one of those crises serving as a catalyst for transformation.
- Marx and Engels were in global crisis during the writing of the *Communist Manifesto*.
- The materialist method: nothing can be understood without history - context is everything.
- How white is the text?
  - Race, slavery, and enslavements
  - Concepts of civilized vs uncivilized, East vs West, barbarism.
- How difficult is the text to read? *The Communist Manifesto* is intended to be a layman's text. It is supposed to be easygoing.
- Marx and Engels were commissioned to write a manifesto for the League of the Just (later the Communist Party). 
- Three 'chapters': the Historical, the Polemic, the Academic.
- The purpose of the *Manifesto* is platform rather than argument - it is a small, compact pamphlet with the purpose to agglomerate, synthesize, and create chared purpose.
- Written in the tone of revolution.
  - 1848 revolution; revolution around every century.
  - Uprisings were occuring in almost every European nation, transofrmation from monarchy to society.
  - Two countries stayed out of revolution: Great Britain and Russia. 
    - Great Britain enfranchised working men and had sufficient infrastructure and industrial reforms; the working class were placated.
    - In Russia, revolution was down the corner. A lack of connections prevented earlier revolution.
  - Benedict Anderson and the study of modern nationalism: the birth of the popular press and media, the birth of modern nationalism - 'print nationalism'.
    - Anderson's interpretation has been criticized for privileging literacy.
  - Ideas must be written; they are much more quickly disseminated in print.
    - The novel makes modern nationalism possible. Novels disseminate shared belonging with others. 
    - Sense of cohesion - rising up together, sharing a consciousness.
- Discontentment with royalty: abandoning the teutonic, the tribal, in favor of the democratic, and liberal - the emergence of national government.
- Technology - the railrod (especially in connecting the coast to eh interior), newspapers, education, industrialization.
  - Factories bring lots of workers together in one room, in a way that feudalism never could.
    - Ideas begin flashing around.
    - Technology enables the faster transmission of ideas. It becomes materially possible.
- Starvation - the potato family, environmental catastrophes. There is lack of sustinence; people are angry and famished.
- French revolution in 1789, American revolution in 1775 to 1783, second French revolution in 1618 - creation of a constitutional democracy.
- Initial title: "Professions of Faith" - Communism as religion.
- The Manifesto as a genre exists not as political but rather as a religious text, a sovereign declaration or an interpretation of scripture (usually by the clergy).
  - Transition from religious to a secular worldview.
  - The concept of the Manifesto not as religious but as a political document was pioneered by Marx and Engels.
- Changed title: "Principles of Communism". This Manifesto is not quite a set of principles; Manifestos are dynamic, performative works that are not static. They seek not only to understand but also to mold and shape the world around them.
- Manifestos as bringing about human freedom.
- Main theoretical contributions of the text
  - Much of production - the way that social and economic means of organization - are subject to change, and are never completely static.
    - Darwin and Marx - writing at the same time
    - Revolution and evolution
    - You cannot have revolution without evolution, and vice versa
    - Capitalism is not permanent
  - Projecting the long term tendencies of capitalism.
    - Capitalism will become global. No other text in the 19th century would have predicted this.
    - Capitalism as a global phenomenon - it will keep an expanding into every scope of the world.
  - Thinking about and understanding other economists. Adam Smith and *The Wealth of Nations* - evolutionary optimism is naive and misguided. 
- So far, there have been no international overthrows. Were Marx and Engels simply young idealists?

Questions to think about:
1. How does the 'spectre haunting Europe' set the mood? What impact does the language of a threatening spectre create?
2. How is the bourgeoisie characterized in the text?
3. How is the proletariat described?
4. How is the idea of class described?
5. How are the Communists described?
6. How is the idea of a historical transformation described?
7. How do ideas of literature, education, and culture manifest in the text? How are they treated?
8. How is capital described?
9. To whom is the text addressed?
10. How is gender treated in the text?
11. How is race treated in the text?
12. How are ideas of individuality treated in the text?


Ideas from Discussion
- Capital is collective, a social process. Cpaital as formed socially. Creation of commodities and wealth. Social possession and social power.
- Abolition of *private* rather than personal property.
- Capital holds social power, but is only understood as private in the context of capital society. The Goal of the Communists: to return social power and capital to the people that generated it (or whose labor who generated it).
- Means of production: how commodities are made.
- How are the bourgeoisie described? Who owns capital? - the bourgeoisie are the destroyers of what came before. Destroyed the power of the feudal system.
- The petty 'boutique' bourgeoisie
- The bourgeoisie as a revolutionary class
- The bourgeoisie control the nation-state - the laws, power, 'freedom', education, whatnot - an assertion of 'freedom', but for whom?
- Commofidifcation of everything, including people - later, commodification of labor power.
- Who gets to be the revolutionary class? Classes that exist will decay, collapsing into bourgeois and proletariat.
- The feudal system and the capitalist system
  - Feudal system: structured with God, King, the nobility, clergy, the three estates. No social mobility - ordainment and religion.
  - Capitalist system: the most social mobility, mobility downwards.
- The bourgeoisie shake up the system: the petty bourgeois expands the revolutionary impulse. 
- There is always a struggle. What are the big ideas?
- Theory itself is a literary text. It is not merely to be applied.
