## Week 1 Tuesday - Syllabus and Course Introduction
- Today - give an overview of what will be happening in the quarter.
- Not an easy class. If it's not for you, don't take it.
- History of the class
  - Taught over 20 years
  - Marxism taught trhough the backdoor
  - Marxism needed to be integrated into the department
  - Argued to be the most central couruse for English majors
  - 2008 financial crisis - important to understand this.
  - In 2008, lobbied to put the course on the books. Became a listed English course.
  - At certain times, there has been a certain amount of anxiety. Rides different waves of politics. There is always a waitlist about the class.
  - The conservative backlash. 
  - Marxist theory as central to life in the 21st century.
  - *Corona Capitalism* - crisis has revealed disparities in wealth and resources in truly profound ways.
- The course is principally an examination of a Marxist approach to analysis of culture and literature. Not necessarily as a political philosophy. As a critical/naalytical framework. Not Marxism as a political philosophy,, but talking about Marxism as a critical/analytical framework.
- Way of thinking about power as it manifests in culture and literature - impacted by forces of power, including the capitalist system as it racializes, sexualizes, genders, and creates identity.
- Political philosophy grounded in an analyssi of economics and history. How to get from economics and history to culture and literature. There are Marxist scholars in every discipline. How do they turn a theory of economics and history into a theory of literature and culture?
- Marx was a bit of a polymath, reading very broadly in emergent subjects.
- Boils down to a historical shift; we've moved incrementally into a present moment from an analysis of literature as aesthetic, beautiful, artistic, pertaining to universal truths/values - to an understanding of literature as social, historical, and full of power and contestation.
- All teachers - whether they announce themselves as Marxists or not - have been influenced by Marxist teachings, which have saturated the Academy.
- New Criticism. Puts together a version of literary scholarship focused on the aesthetic, form, and questions of beauty. Nnot interested in questions of power and politics. 
- Brings about an approach to culture expressed in power dynamics in class, culture, race, gender, sexuality.
- Important to recognize different modalities of power. Can be reified as identities. Categorization, division, hierarchization. Nothing natural about modalities; imposed to make capitalism go.
- Racism, sexism, homophobia, and capitalism - the isms, the systems of power. Race, gender, sexuality, class. -isms intersect. The language of intersectionality is a celebrated language.
- Weinbaum argues that feminism, CRTS, post-colonial studies, sexuality studies, cultural studies, etc. - modes of inquiry only possible because of Marxism. They are not merely derivative - the very idea of studying power comes from Marxism.
- You can't have feminist without Marxism; you can't have anti-racist theory without Marxism, etc.
- Intellectual history of Marxism is the influential framework that allows for thes eother theories to emerge. 
- (No breaks, and no powerpoints. Post-break discussion usually lags. Usually we roll for as long as possible, then conclude discussion.)
- Kimberle Crenshaw, responsible for creating the bogeyman CRT and intersectionality.
- Checking out - is there a way in which Staurt Hall - 'race is the modality in which class is lived'. Intersectional formulation. People wer ealready beginning to think through connections.
- Is there a natural affinity between capitalism and racism? Does capitalism need racism in order to go?
- Is there a natural affinity between sexism and homophobia?
- What are the hierarchies of power that have needed to be set inplace for capitalism to sustain itself?
- A Marxist approach empahsizes that there are material constraints that produce social, political, and economic power relationships and thus the hierarchy of race, gender, class. Bound up with capitalism. This changes the way we study literature.
- Marxism brings hierarchical orderings of power into focus.
- No one debate you that we live in a capitalist world system. No part of this planet has not been impacted by capitalist modernity.
- Marxism is the only and principal method to understand capitalism - and it's the only course in the UW. What does it tell you about capitalism?
- Why is it that the one philosophy develpoped over a century is not taught in every classroom, because we live in a capitalist world.
- Main argument: Marxism is the principal tool for understanding the capitalist system we live in. 
  - To not teach it is an 'insanity'
- What does this history mean for students of English and culture more broadly?
- Cultural Studies - intellectual formation that began in Britain and arrived to the US. Applying Marxist theory to culture, disseminates through teh Academy, inflitrates New Criticism
- Marxism is the post powerful method for interpreting the dominant culture.
- Marxist theory steps away from it. It's not an endorser. It sees systems from the outside. Marxist theory suggests there is nothing natural about capitalism, and that it is an invention.
- What does it mean to look at capitallist systems from a distance. 
- Culture has a complex relationship with capitalism.
- Culture supports and contests capitalism. 
- Most culture doesn't think explicitly in terms of capitalism. How does it exist within the capitalist ecosystem? Nothing is neutral, it is always political. There is nothing neutral. 
- Mediation - how does culture mediate capitalism? Different theories of mediation.
- "We are living in conservative times"
- Nancy Hartsock and standpoint epistemology
- The Academy exists within the capitalist world and to some extent accomodates the capitalist system.
- Four reasons why Marxist literary theory is the best tool for understanding life today and for understanding literature and culture today.
  1. Marxism has become more, or not less, relevant in the lsat 200 years since the period of its invention. We are living in Marx and Engels's predictions for the future. In some ways, Marx's conflicts, differences, etc. was visible in Marxist times (think - Dickens), but today capitalism is not merely a European phenomenon. We are living now in late capitalism, or an entrenched capitalism in which capitalist logics and ways of being saturate every being of our life.
    - Neoliberalism - an ideology of late capitlaism suggesting the market values of being should be how we exist in the world.
    - The market as not something to be contested but rather to be embraced
    - 'Express love with a diamond ring' - how do we get o a formulation from that. How do commodities and the purchasing of things become an expression of worth and human value?
  2. We become more global - literally. We live in a global world. Marx teaches us that *people* make history - not kings or presidents, but rather masses, collectivites, the Proletariat - constnatly engaged in struggle and the world in which we share.
    - Neither the coronavirus nor culture obey political lines.
    - Which culture dominates, which culture rises to the top?
    - Some say that American culture is global culture. 
    - How does this speak to the situation of America? Flows go in multiple directions
    - Modern femininity emerged simultaneously across the world. Had to do with the global flow of commodities - clothing, lipstick, skin lighteners, tampons, etc. Creating modern versions of feminity. These modern flows came from Japan and China to the rest of the world, rather than vice versa.
    - Literature represents a global world. This global culture is not always on the side of the ruling class.
    - Culture is a site of conflict. Marx would say that it is a site of class conflict. Marxist theory allows us to understand this, to percieve the struggle and conflict in culture. Trying to parse or interpret culture is itself a political act. To not see culture as a political entity is to erase its participation in power relationships. How does power emenate from 'universal values' or aesthetics?
    - Universal values as a capitalist ruse
    - Marx suggested that the point is not merely to interpret the world, but to change it. The difference between a Marxist scholar and a scholar informed by Marxism. 
  3. Marxist theory makes us conscious about political and economic lens. You will never write a paper the same again.
  4. We will be able to traverse from theories of economics and politics to a theory of literature.

**Syllabus.**
- Marxist theory is a huge iceberg. A large body of work by Marx and Engels.
- Marx & Engels wrote 50 volumes of writing - a massive body of work. 9 volumes are the collected letters. Other 41 volumes are published and unpublished works.
- Marxism gets taken up by people all over the world. Many philosophers decide to build upon Marx and Engel's work, as well as political actors - Lenin, Mao, etc. Althusser, Angela Davis.
- We are not debating experiments in communism - Soviet Union, North Korea, etc. Not about the political philosophy, but rather the critical methods that can be derived from those courses. Political questions are for political science courses.
- Many Marxists didn't give any attention to literature and culture.
- There is on universal Marxist orthodoxy, but rather a range of experiments. Vast body of philosophy that can teach us a lot.
- You want the translator Samuel Moore - this was the translation that Marx and Engels approved. 
- First reader response - you can't think without writing. Due on Monday of Week 2. 
- Two classes of the Communist Manifesto, then turning to Theses Concerning Feuerbach
- From capital to ideology - a thought system that works in certain ways to aid and abet systems of power. A theory of ideology is a theory of mediation. 
- Responses must be 750 or 1000 words, exactly. Writing and concision.
- Partial grade contract course. You are living up to a standard of deep engagement. All your papers must be at the standard of deep engagement. 
- The instructor will grade if it is meeting the standard or not on three responses.
- 7 responses for a 3.8 to 4.0. 
- You must complete responses 3, 5, 7.
- All responses must respond to the prompt.

## Week 1 Thursday - Parts I and II of *The Communist Manifesto*
- Naomi Klein, *Corona Capitalism* - much has happened in the past few years. It reads differently in retrospect.
  - The *Manifesto* is about crises, recurring crises - crises veer off into new directions, new ideas and eras, revolutions. Hurculean jumps are possible in crises.
  - The Pandemic was thought to maybe be one of those crises serving as a catalyst for transformation.
- Marx and Engels were in global crisis during the writing of the *Communist Manifesto*.
- The materialist method: nothing can be understood without history - context is everything.
- How white is the text?
  - Race, slavery, and enslavements
  - Concepts of civilized vs uncivilized, East vs West, barbarism.
- How difficult is the text to read? *The Communist Manifesto* is intended to be a layman's text. It is supposed to be easygoing.
- Marx and Engels were commissioned to write a manifesto for the League of the Just (later the Communist Party). 
- Three 'chapters': the Historical, the Polemic, the Academic.
- The purpose of the *Manifesto* is platform rather than argument - it is a small, compact pamphlet with the purpose to agglomerate, synthesize, and create chared purpose.
- Written in the tone of revolution.
  - 1848 revolution; revolution around every century.
  - Uprisings were occuring in almost every European nation, transofrmation from monarchy to society.
  - Two countries stayed out of revolution: Great Britain and Russia. 
    - Great Britain enfranchised working men and had sufficient infrastructure and industrial reforms; the working class were placated.
    - In Russia, revolution was down the corner. A lack of connections prevented earlier revolution.
  - Benedict Anderson and the study of modern nationalism: the birth of the popular press and media, the birth of modern nationalism - 'print nationalism'.
    - Anderson's interpretation has been criticized for privileging literacy.
  - Ideas must be written; they are much more quickly disseminated in print.
    - The novel makes modern nationalism possible. Novels disseminate shared belonging with others. 
    - Sense of cohesion - rising up together, sharing a consciousness.
- Discontentment with royalty: abandoning the teutonic, the tribal, in favor of the democratic, and liberal - the emergence of national government.
- Technology - the railrod (especially in connecting the coast to eh interior), newspapers, education, industrialization.
  - Factories bring lots of workers together in one room, in a way that feudalism never could.
    - Ideas begin flashing around.
    - Technology enables the faster transmission of ideas. It becomes materially possible.
- Starvation - the potato family, environmental catastrophes. There is lack of sustinence; people are angry and famished.
- French revolution in 1789, American revolution in 1775 to 1783, second French revolution in 1618 - creation of a constitutional democracy.
- Initial title: "Professions of Faith" - Communism as religion.
- The Manifesto as a genre exists not as political but rather as a religious text, a sovereign declaration or an interpretation of scripture (usually by the clergy).
  - Transition from religious to a secular worldview.
  - The concept of the Manifesto not as religious but as a political document was pioneered by Marx and Engels.
- Changed title: "Principles of Communism". This Manifesto is not quite a set of principles; Manifestos are dynamic, performative works that are not static. They seek not only to understand but also to mold and shape the world around them.
- Manifestos as bringing about human freedom.
- Main theoretical contributions of the text
  - Much of production - the way that social and economic means of organization - are subject to change, and are never completely static.
    - Darwin and Marx - writing at the same time
    - Revolution and evolution
    - You cannot have revolution without evolution, and vice versa
    - Capitalism is not permanent
  - Projecting the long term tendencies of capitalism.
    - Capitalism will become global. No other text in the 19th century would have predicted this.
    - Capitalism as a global phenomenon - it will keep an expanding into every scope of the world.
  - Thinking about and understanding other economists. Adam Smith and *The Wealth of Nations* - evolutionary optimism is naive and misguided. 
- So far, there have been no international overthrows. Were Marx and Engels simply young idealists?

Questions to think about:
1. How does the 'spectre haunting Europe' set the mood? What impact does the language of a threatening spectre create?
2. How is the bourgeoisie characterized in the text?
3. How is the proletariat described?
4. How is the idea of class described?
5. How are the Communists described?
6. How is the idea of a historical transformation described?
7. How do ideas of literature, education, and culture manifest in the text? How are they treated?
8. How is capital described?
9. To whom is the text addressed?
10. How is gender treated in the text?
11. How is race treated in the text?
12. How are ideas of individuality treated in the text?


Ideas from Discussion
- Capital is collective, a social process. Cpaital as formed socially. Creation of commodities and wealth. Social possession and social power.
- Abolition of *private* rather than personal property.
- Capital holds social power, but is only understood as private in the context of capital society. The Goal of the Communists: to return social power and capital to the people that generated it (or whose labor who generated it).
- Means of production: how commodities are made.
- How are the bourgeoisie described? Who owns capital? - the bourgeoisie are the destroyers of what came before. Destroyed the power of the feudal system.
- The petty 'boutique' bourgeoisie
- The bourgeoisie as a revolutionary class
- The bourgeoisie control the nation-state - the laws, power, 'freedom', education, whatnot - an assertion of 'freedom', but for whom?
- Commofidifcation of everything, including people - later, commodification of labor power.
- Who gets to be the revolutionary class? Classes that exist will decay, collapsing into bourgeois and proletariat.
- The feudal system and the capitalist system
  - Feudal system: structured with God, King, the nobility, clergy, the three estates. No social mobility - ordainment and religion.
  - Capitalist system: the most social mobility, mobility downwards.
- The bourgeoisie shake up the system: the petty bourgeois expands the revolutionary impulse. 
- There is always a struggle. What are the big ideas?
- Theory itself is a literary text. It is not merely to be applied.

## Week 2 Tuesday, *The Communist Manifesto* Continued
- What is class?
- 1840 as the year of revolution
- What is capital? Capital as social power/people power, or as private property. Competing definitions.
  - The capitalist: capital = private property
  - The Marxist: capital = social power
- Marxism - return social power to the people. Capital as social power, a collective/social product.
- Capitalist view of capital - owned, held, private.
- Marxist and Capital views - necessary supplementary, but antagonistic.
- Who is the bourgeoisie? The Bourgeoisie - the former revolutionary power, seized from the feudal system.
- The bourgeoisie is a self-created system; all opwer is accumulation. emerge out of the petite bourgeoisie, ownership over the means of production and the production process.
  - The bourgeoisie accumulate enough to re-invest capital into the generation of capital - accumulation.
- Continuous revolution creates unsustainable growth, an unsustainable system. Forecasting the global expansion, the shark-like nature of global capitalism.
- Figure of the sorcerer - conjuring the world and its gravedigger.
- Instability - not merely fiscal, but continual impoverishment of the poeple that serve as the basis of that world.
- Most societies are capitalist; in Ameirca, there is the notion of the 'middle class'.
- Marx - the antagonism is messy in the middle. Petite bourgeoisie.
- Production of major forces that rub up against each other.
- The Proletariat - who are the proletariats? How are they described?
- Page 5 - paid wage laborers. People earn a wage for their labor - labor as their only property - these are the proletariat.
- Implicit masculinization - but differences in sex are described as transgressed by the reach of capital (pp. 10). Marx understood that childre, women, etc. were especially exploited. Marx's understanding of race is complicated. 
- Paid vs unpaid laborers - 'paid'ness as essential to the proletariat. Competition on the basis of wage laborer is the basis for capital. 'Enslaved by the machine'. Presents a relevant analysis for slaves, who are unpaid laborers.
- Is work abstracted and speicalization erased? Or do people retain skills but somehow get projected upon a scale of capital and value?
- Wage slavery as a term or concept - is this problematic?
- Ruling ideas are of the bourgeoisie, ideas and ideology. Capital constitutes not only the means of production but a mode of life.
- What is a class/How is class understood?
- Class - a relation to capital, creator vs. controller. Influence of power and social relationships.
  - There must be a struggle, an antagonism.
  - Complementary - one class cannot exist without the other.
  - Easy definition of class: a relationship. Relationships change over time. The historical transformation of history is that of class antagonisms.
  - Communism proposes an overthrow of class, a different existence altogether.
  - A Utopianism of marxism - the language of league, association, union, continuation
- Question - how is historical transformation represented in the text? How is a theory of history presented?
  - History - conflict leads to societal change. 
  - What counts as history?
  - Struggle and questions of relationship
  - How is the question of historical change represented?
  - History as struggle between the powerless and the powerful, power struggles emerging in cyclic phases as a result of power imbalance that oscillates more wildly and wildly until the 'end of class history' is reached.
- Pyramid model of class relationships - who is below whom?
- The petite bourgeoisie
- History changes from a minoritarian to a majoritarian struggle, from the small to the large. A new kind of history is coming.
- Marx is to history what Darwin was to evolution, Engels claims.
  - Evolution - natural transformation, somehow material (?)
  - Natural/inevitability about transformation.
  - Evolution is about survival - a materialist analysis.
  - Inevitability of *historical* transformation, the need for something to happen.
- Complex interplay between the 'material' and 'pushed' evolution, between an evolution that progresses by itself and an evolution that needs to be pushed along.
- Some crises don't lead to change, but that they happen is 'fixed'. Not every crisis leads to radical change.
- Progression - historied progress? Do things move to a place that's better? Does the 'moral arc of history bend towards justice'?
- Is history cyclical?
- Inevitability of history: the need for the *Communist Manifesto* as a literary object of history. A push is needed, somehow - even though the *Communist Manifesto* itself rhetorically argues for the inevitability of the rise and victory of the proletariat.
  - Are these two visions of historical evolution really competing?
- **What is the theory of literature?** The production of the book itself - literary roles in historical transofrmation.
- Something antagonistic, unsure, contingent. Uncertainty.
- There will always be class conflict and crises, but then need to be shaped into.
- The nuance between gathering and haping - what is the role of literature? What is the role of the material earth?
  - Gathering - there is a material reality that we lump together into theory and literature
  - Shaping - contouring and shaping the material reality through theory and literature
- Pages 6-7: a different paradigm of movement. Marx - what is modernity? Modernity is a world in flux, agitation, change, uncertainty, perpetual flux.
  > "All that is solid melts into air" -pp.6
- Globalization - material and intellectual production. World literature emerges from the bourgeoisie - it produces the 'global literature' that leads to its downfall.
- Prefaces - the translations, The *Communist Manifesto* is world literature, translated by necessity into languages of the world.
- To whom is the text addressed? A significant part of the proletariat could not read.
- An alternative view of history and capitalism.
- A lot of literature calls itself Communist or Socialist - third section is a rebuttal against these systems. Key insight: these systems of thought are out of phase with history. They may have been imported by France but placed into a much different German context, or attempt to dial back history to the feudalist system.
- The vision: to shape productive forces used for something other than capital.

---

## Week 2 Thursday, *The Communist Manifesto*, "Theses on Feuerbach", and "Bartleby, The Scrivener"
- The Melville discussion will continue on to Tuesday.
- Repsonses - got to half with comments.
- Overall, the responses were well-written. helpful responses ask questions rather than trying to make full-fledged claims, which arguably we are not ready to make yet.
- Always double space your reading responses.
- Previous discussion: tensions between the essence of history - inevitability vs produding. Difference in the modern class tension as to previous class tensions - the proletariat is larger, more powerful, more majoritarian in nature.
  - Darwinism - the natural, the inevitable, the evolutionary, the teleological
  - Alternative perspective: history needs to be pushed by those that understand the existing inequalities the best (i.e. the proletariat), to create transofrmation.
  - *The Communist Manifesto* as a product of oral literature. Capitalism has created the conditions for the liberation of man. Conditions are appropriated for the bourgeoisie, supporting the processes of alienation - but nonetheless Marx and Engels are not interested in a romanticist/idealist anticapitalism, but rather a critical understanding that acknowledges capitalism created the conditions for its fall.
- *The Communist Manifesto* is not a novel, but a Manifesto. Marx and Engels invent the modern manifesto to talk about revolution.
- *Theses on Feuerbach* - to paraphrase, the point is not merely to interpret but the change the world.
- *The Communist Manifesto* is a performative literary work, one that engages in a meaningful, active performnace.
- *The Communist Manifesto* brings the spectre into the world; it is palpable, comprehendable. The *Manifesto* is the sorcerer itself, too - conjuring alternative realities. As the Sorcerer, the things you conjure may be out of your control.
- Melting of all that is solid into air - aided and abetted by literature. 
- The *Manifesto* both records and makes history. *perfromacne*.
- Can literature do this? We uncover a theory of literature itself.
- Revolution is a literary battleground, a war of competing cultures, values, and ideas.
- Materialist idea - we cannot have ideas that are not connected to our material reality. In contrast with idealism - ideas floating out in the ether.
- The revolution takes place on the page.
- Section 3: crtiqieu of other socialist ideas, a contoured exploration of the socialist and communist ideologies. Communism - attaches to the proletariat.
- Professor Weinbaum: celebrate the Communists for being driven not by philosophical experiments but rather by the life, work, and conditions on the ground.
- Other literature is out of phase with history - it channels ideas into the proletariat, instead of gathering from the proletariat.
- Feuerbach - a member of the German 'true' socialism ideology.
- Utopian socialism - interesting in that utopian socialists have actually created communities. There is a long history of utopian organization with alternative ways of life and being. *Eve and the new Jerusalem*. Marx and Engels thought this wrong - a bourgeoisie experiment, for rich people.
- Responses - idea that came throughout - notes about gender. Marxist feminists point to six key passages in Marx's canon to understand gender.
- People usually go to Engels - *The Original of the Family, State, and Private Property*.
- Engagement with native American ethos; the emergent field of anthropology; the Iriquois were a matriarchal society, a precapitalist class. Male power as on top is a fiction invented by bourgeois society; there was a different form of being that preexisted capitalism. Of course, this itself is another fiction. Capitalism overthrows equitable soceity; capitalism needs the oppression of women to go; this is implicitly recognized in the text.
- Why does the end of capitalism mean the end of gendered oppression? This maintains the fiction of a pre-history.
- The end of prostitution, and the rise of liberation. Bourgeois women are oppressed by being considered property, but in the working classes the question was women and children, who had no property because no one in the working classes could have property; not specifically acknowledged.
- The bourgeoisie have already created a ring of prostitution, a 'community of women' - trading wives, whatnot. A rebuttal to the allegation of communism as creating a 'community of women'.
- We can learn more aobut gender from Communist literature; are women a class? There are women in every class. Is there a cross-cutitng class? 
- Supplementary systems that need each other - sexism, racism, capitalism, etc.
- W.E.B. Du Bois, *Black Reconstruction*
- *The Communist Manifesto* is an index of the speed of communism and the possibility of the idea throughout the world; where is the idea accepted? Where is the internationalism of the working class understood?
- The preface is celebratory, announcing the expansion of international communism.
- text as a history of the modern working class movement. 
- Marx is a humanist - what does capitalism do to human relationships? Produces alienation in three key ways: alientation from the product, alienation from labor, alientation from each other. Lack of humanness - people become commodities and competition.
- Communism brings about the potential for a new way to relate.

"Theses on Feuerbach"
- Feuerbach - popular in the 1800s, was a big theorist.
- Wrote two big books on christianity.x
- Marx emerged in the German Academy, the Young Hegelians. This text is a criticism of the master; Marx flipped the Hegelian dialectic theory on its head into historical materialism.
- Hegel - God has no separation from man, it is relating human essence to humans; God is a projection of man. Secular and anti-religious philosophy.
- Cutting through the alientation with God; alientation is redressed mentally. However, Marx proposed that alientation was not mental, but a material problem. Alientation is a product of the world, of life in capitalism - how and for whom we labor.
- Three-fold alientation - the way we survive, not projection of hopes onto God.
- Alientation must be addressed materially. Philosophy cannot get rid of alientation, but material revolution can.
- "Contemplative Materialism" - materialism that happens int he mind instead of the lived reality.
- Theses - famous for being short and succint.
- Marx and Engels, *The German Ideology*. A set of departures.
- Engels wrot ethe first draft of the *Manifesto*, Marx revised and made final edits.
- Complex history of transaltion and collaboration.

Melville
- Melville was a key figure in 19th century literature. He is part of the American literary canon.
- You don't know the alternatives until you read the canon. Do not discard the works in the cnaon.
- Born 1819 through 1891 from  a 'double revolutionary' family. The family was left quite poor after the early death of the father. 
- Melville traveled at sea; upon his return, he began his literary career. He later married and had four children, but lost two (his sons).
- Melville tries to live in rural Massachusetts and is close friends with Nathaniel Hawthorne. 
- Stopped writing adventure novels, no longer catering to the literary marketplace - went out of fashion.
- Canonization came after death, posthumous realization of Melville's formal complexity
- New Crticisim - interested in form, aesthetics, symbolism - found Melville very relevant.
- Ecoriticism of Melville.
- Squatting, property, inequality in New York City.
  - Jacob Astor - bought up the city, possessed most of lower Manhattan.
  - Vagrancy was used forcefully in the United States to imprison people who refused to work for a wage. Freed slaves were rounded up into chain gangs to rebuild the South.
- problems about homelessness in the United States, legal support for the American capitalist system.
- Slaves were the biggest commodities to the United States.

## Week 3 Tuesday, "Bartleby, the Scrivener" and “The Ideological Tensions of Capitlaism: Universalism versus Racism and Sexism” by Wallerstein
- We are now entering a unit on racial capitalism - intersection of race and class.
- A film is assigned for next Thursday: film watching should not merely be passive. Start and pause, engage with the film, watch multiple times if needed.
- Look for significant phrases, camera operations, etc.
- Upcoming Thursday - popular pieces on racism and capitalism, slavery and capitalism. Prof. Weinbaum likes to teach the 1619 project, which has been attacked significantly; students should read the writing being attacked and understand the attack. There are some good critiques of the 1619 project, specifically from a historical angle.

"Bartleby, the Scrivener", Melville
- We are building upon what was said in the discussion. 
- Melville - very careful writer from the perspective of the bourgeois. Develops the consciousness of the capitalist. 
- How does the narrator understnad the worker? How do we get to and understand the essence of capitalism when the dominant ideology supports it?
- The narrator's attitude towards Bartleby is problematic
- Understand that 'prfer' is a passive expression of refusal, a brilliant response that makes us aware that the refusal is made in a constrained situation.
- What can't the other workers see? What if they do know or understand what Bartleby is doing, but the narrator cannot reliably capture it?
- What is Bartleby protesting, if he is protesting?
- Conditions - everyone is segmented, separated, divided between people.
- Factory-like work: long hours, uncomfortable workspaces, incredible strain on the bodies.
- Nippers, Turkey, Ginger-Nut: all foods. Status as a commodity.
- What's happening at the end of the piece?
- MOdern usage of the word 'critique' comes from Marx. Is "Bartleby, the Scrivener" a critique of capitalism?
- What are we to make of the end of thes tory?
- Interchangeable properties - geared towards capitalism.
- What is the state of the narrator before/after Bartleby's imprisonment, then before/after Bartleby's death?
- Pity and self-centeredness, Christian help complex. Wallerstein: workers as subject to change in administration.
- Is "Bartleby, the Scrivener" a lament, despair of life in capitalism? An argument against individualism? Or a tale of abandonmnet, of letters that failed, that didn't do what they were supposed to do, crushed like a dead letter. Bartleby is a letter that has no recipient, the world literature without a world.
- Cognitive distortion around Bartleby - what is Bartleby's role in social relations?
- What if writing has no recipient? What if nothing happens? "Ah, Bartleby! Ah, humanity!"
- Obfuscation of responsibility: "It was not I that brought you here" - guilt, assimilation, excalpation, mask of complicit involvement, savior complex/moral bankrupcy, false fraternity
- Humanization that's not quite humanizing. Capitalism: branding unearned privilege and power as earned. Meritocracy - Wallerstein.
- Fiction can give us the interiority of life in capitalism that theorys truggles with.
- Comparison of the workplace to the jail: green screen vs the green grass, looking at dead walls, imprisonment and work are parallel.
- What letter can get into the consciousness? What sort of letter will be read?
- Melville as Bartleby, a lament of writing letters that have no recipient. Objectivity in capitalism: numbing effects of life in capitalism.

“The Ideological Tensions of Capitlaism: Universalism versus Racism and Sexism”, Wallerstein
- How did Marx understand race?
- S. Hall: race is the modality in which class is lived. Is gender/sexuality/ableism a link too?
- In traditional Marxism, class is pulled as separate.
- Who is the proletariat today? What has come together?
- Wallerstein - a Marxist sociologist, focuse don economic questions.
- Began studying postcolonial Affirca, particularly South Africa. Studied Apartheid: how is global positioning dependent on a racial caste system?
- Developer of World Systems Theory, a subset of Marxist scholarship: a way of thinking about global capitlaism.
- Anticipates the North/South global conflict at a time in which the dominant mode of scholarship on global conflict was focused on the East-West Cold War/Communism-Capitalism dynamic.
- Two ideas: the core and the periphery. These are racialized terms, dependency theorists. We have primarily bourgeois nations that function in the world as bourgoeis entities, and there are majority proletariat nations that constitute the periphery.
- Does not believe in the 'third world', but rather the one world system separated into labor and capital.
- Do you need to be paid to be the proletariat? There are 17 million slaves today: we are moving towards a world with increasing slavery. Periphery provides the mateirals that the core accumulates and uses to produce items that the periphery are forced to consume.
- No nation is completely one or another statically. (e.g. China)
- There is a South in the north - poverty in very wealthy nations. 
- Questions to think about:
  1. How does Wallerstein build the argument? Where does he stand?
  2. How does capitalism emerge as a universal system?
  3. How does capitlaism rely upon particularity?
- Key terms: universality, particularity, meritocracy.
- Argument about capitalism as meritocracy. Everything tells us that capitalism is meritocracy.
- Intellectula history of the development of capitalism: one way that universality can be preserved through Enlightenment philosophy.
- Natural states - the Enlightenment gives us a lot of ideas to support Enlightenmnet ideology; you can't have capitalism without the Enlightenmnet/Protestantism (anti-Weberians).
- Universal citizenship - universal applicability of these systems, categories of accountability, as if they are available to all.
- **Universality is always undercut by particularity. There is no universality without particularity.** A universal system must have exclusion - if everyone had citizenship, then there is no citizenry at all. Universality is predicated upon the production of particularisms.
- Nothing cannot be turned into a commodity. PSV - slave doctrines.
- The commodification of repdocution and of life itself. Surrogacy is a multi-billion dollar business.
- Meritocracy is unstable. People don't want to be told that someone else is doing better because they worked harder, but because they inherited it. **You restabilize meritocracy with the inventions of populations that don't deserve - racism, sexism, etc.**
