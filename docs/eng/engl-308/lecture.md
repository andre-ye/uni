## Week 1 Tuesday - Syllabus
- Today - give an overview of what will be happening in the quarter.
- Not an easy class. If it's not for you, don't take it.
- History of the class
  - Taught over 20 years
  - Marxism taught trhough the backdoor
  - Marxism needed to be integrated into the department
  - Argued to be the most central couruse for English majors
  - 2008 financial crisis - important to understand this.
  - In 2008, lobbied to put the course on the books. Became a listed English course.
  - At certain times, there has been a certain amount of anxiety. Rides different waves of politics. There is always a waitlist about the class.
  - The conservative backlash. 
  - Marxist theory as central to life in the 21st century.
  - *Corona Capitalism* - crisis has revealed disparities in wealth and resources in truly profound ways.
- The course is principally an examination of a Marxist approach to analysis of culture and literature. Not necessarily as a political philosophy. As a critical/naalytical framework. Not Marxism as a political philosophy,, but talking about Marxism as a critical/analytical framework.
- Way of thinking about power as it manifests in culture and literature - impacted by forces of power, including the capitalist system as it racializes, sexualizes, genders, and creates identity.
- Political philosophy grounded in an analyssi of economics and history. How to get from economics and history to culture and literature. There are Marxist scholars in every discipline. How do they turn a theory of economics and history into a theory of literature and culture?
- Marx was a bit of a polymath, reading very broadly in emergent subjects.
- Boils down to a historical shift; we've moved incrementally into a present moment from an analysis of literature as aesthetic, beautiful, artistic, pertaining to universal truths/values - to an understanding of literature as social, historical, and full of power and contestation.
- All teachers - whether they announce themselves as Marxists or not - have been influenced by Marxist teachings, which have saturated the Academy.
- New Criticism. Puts together a version of literary scholarship focused on the aesthetic, form, and questions of beauty. Nnot interested in questions of power and politics. 
- Brings about an approach to culture expressed in power dynamics in class, culture, race, gender, sexuality.
- Important to recognize different modalities of power. Can be reified as identities. Categorization, division, hierarchization. Nothing natural about modalities; imposed to make capitalism go.
- Racism, sexism, homophobia, and capitalism - the isms, the systems of power. Race, gender, sexuality, class. -isms intersect. The language of intersectionality is a celebrated language.
- Weinbaum argues that feminism, CRTS, post-colonial studies, sexuality studies, cultural studies, etc. - modes of inquiry only possible because of Marxism. They are not merely derivative - the very idea of studying power comes from Marxism.
- You can't have feminist without Marxism; you can't have anti-racist theory without Marxism, etc.
- Intellectual history of Marxism is the influential framework that allows for thes eother theories to emerge. 
- (No breaks, and no powerpoints. Post-break discussion usually lags. Usually we roll for as long as possible, then conclude discussion.)
- Kimberle Crenshaw, responsible for creating the bogeyman CRT and intersectionality.
- Checking out - is there a way in which Staurt Hall - 'race is the modality in which class is lived'. Intersectional formulation. People wer ealready beginning to think through connections.
- Is there a natural affinity between capitalism and racism? Does capitalism need racism in order to go?
- Is there a natural affinity between sexism and homophobia?
- What are the hierarchies of power that have needed to be set inplace for capitalism to sustain itself?
- A Marxist approach empahsizes that there are material constraints that produce social, political, and economic power relationships and thus the hierarchy of race, gender, class. Bound up with capitalism. This changes the way we study literature.
- Marxism brings hierarchical orderings of power into focus.
- No one debate you that we live in a capitalist world system. No part of this planet has not been impacted by capitalist modernity.
- Marxism is the only and principal method to understand capitalism - and it's the only course in the UW. What does it tell you about capitalism?
- Why is it that the one philosophy develpoped over a century is not taught in every classroom, because we live in a capitalist world.
- Main argument: Marxism is the principal tool for understanding the capitalist system we live in. 
  - To not teach it is an 'insanity'
- What does this history mean for students of English and culture more broadly?
- Cultural Studies - intellectual formation that began in Britain and arrived to the US. Applying Marxist theory to culture, disseminates through teh Academy, inflitrates New Criticism
- Marxism is the post powerful method for interpreting the dominant culture.
- Marxist theory steps away from it. It's not an endorser. It sees systems from the outside. Marxist theory suggests there is nothing natural about capitalism, and that it is an invention.
- What does it mean to look at capitallist systems from a distance. 
- Culture has a complex relationship with capitalism.
- Culture supports and contests capitalism. 
- Most culture doesn't think explicitly in terms of capitalism. How does it exist within the capitalist ecosystem? Nothing is neutral, it is always political. There is nothing neutral. 
- Mediation - how does culture mediate capitalism? Different theories of mediation.
- "We are living in conservative times"
- Nancy Hartsock and standpoint epistemology
- The Academy exists within the capitalist world and to some extent accomodates the capitalist system.
- Four reasons why Marxist literary theory is the best tool for understanding life today and for understanding literature and culture today.
  1. Marxism has become more, or not less, relevant in the lsat 200 years since the period of its invention. We are living in Marx and Engels's predictions for the future. In some ways, Marx's conflicts, differences, etc. was visible in Marxist times (think - Dickens), but today capitalism is not merely a European phenomenon. We are living now in late capitalism, or an entrenched capitalism in which capitalist logics and ways of being saturate every being of our life.
    - Neoliberalism - an ideology of late capitlaism suggesting the market values of being should be how we exist in the world.
    - The market as not something to be contested but rather to be embraced
    - 'Express love with a diamond ring' - how do we get o a formulation from that. How do commodities and the purchasing of things become an expression of worth and human value?
  2. We become more global - literally. We live in a global world. Marx teaches us that *people* make history - not kings or presidents, but rather masses, collectivites, the Proletariat - constnatly engaged in struggle and the world in which we share.
    - Neither the coronavirus nor culture obey political lines.
    - Which culture dominates, which culture rises to the top?
    - Some say that American culture is global culture. 
    - How does this speak to the situation of America? Flows go in multiple directions
    - Modern femininity emerged simultaneously across the world. Had to do with the global flow of commodities - clothing, lipstick, skin lighteners, tampons, etc. Creating modern versions of feminity. These modern flows came from Japan and China to the rest of the world, rather than vice versa.
    - Literature represents a global world. This global culture is not always on the side of the ruling class.
    - Culture is a site of conflict. Marx would say that it is a site of class conflict. Marxist theory allows us to understand this, to percieve the struggle and conflict in culture. Trying to parse or interpret culture is itself a political act. To not see culture as a political entity is to erase its participation in power relationships. How does power emenate from 'universal values' or aesthetics?
    - Universal values as a capitalist ruse
    - Marx suggested that the point is not merely to interpret the world, but to change it. The difference between a Marxist scholar and a scholar informed by Marxism. 
  3. Marxist theory makes us conscious about political and economic lens. You will never write a paper the same again.
  4. We will be able to traverse from theories of economics and politics to a theory of literature.

**Syllabus.**

- Marx & Engels wrote 50 volumes of writing - a massive body of work. 9 volumes are the collected letters. Other 41 volumes are published and unpublished works.
- Marxism gets taken up by people all over the world. Many philosophers decide to build upon Marx and Engel's work, as well as political actors - Lenin, Mao, etc. Althusser, Angela Davis.
