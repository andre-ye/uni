# Syllabus - Marxism and Marxist Literary Theory

ENGL 308
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

---

*Alys Weinbaum's syllabus for ENGL 308 is republished publicly here.*

This course introduces several key works by Marx and his collaborator, Engels, and the debates that have grown up around them.  At the center of the course is the question of how 19th century writings about political economy, history, and philosophy were taken up by 20th century literary scholars, and how a distinct tradition of interpreting literature and culture from a Marxist perspective, using Marxist tools, developed over time and endures into the present. By contrast to other models of literary and cultural criticism which often seek to find in literary texts transcendent messages and universal meanings, Marxist theory has sought to situate literary and cultural texts within their historical contexts of production and reception, to understand the power dynamics (including those informed by race, gender, and class conflict) that shape textual meaning, and to explore how such conflicts impact meaning, message, genre, style, and form. 

Our study of Marxist theory will involve us in close, intensive reading of dense philosophical texts.  We seek to understand how a materialist method indebted to Marxism emerged as a dominant method within contemporary scholarship, and how diverse critical practices (often given labels such as “critical theory” or “cultural studies”) are situated within a Marxist analytical tradition.   Over the course of the quarter we will treat two cultural texts--one film and one novel.  We will consider how our understanding of each is shaped by the Marxist frameworks that the course explores, and how each text may be used to reveal the (in)adequacy of Marxist methodologies. 

## Course organization

This course is organized into three units that treat several of the issues and concepts repeatedly returned to by Marx's interpreters: I) History and Class; II) Capitalism and Ideology; and III) Ideology, Literature and Culture.   In Unit I, we focus on the idea of “class,” paying special attention to how social and economic classes function as motors for historical transformation (historical materialism), and how class has been articulated with race and gender in the United States and globally.  In Unit II, we explore the concept of ideology as it was first developed by Marx, and then by later theorists who sought to describe the violence of “idea systems” that obscure the realities of human exploitation.  In Unit III, we examine how ideas of historical materialism and ideology can be used to study literature and culture more broadly.

## Prerequisites and Required Course Wwork

There are no prerequisites for this course.  This noted, students are advised that we will be tackling dense theoretical texts that may require re-reading for comprehension.  You should come to this course wearing your "philosopher hat" - ready to think hard, think outside the box, and engage with big ideas.

Students submit short weekly discussion posts, a midterm paper, and a final paper.  This course counts for "W" credit.

The present plan is for this course to meet in-person.  Lectures and discussion will not be recorded.
