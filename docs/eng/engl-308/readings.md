## *The Communist Manifesto* by Karl Marx and Frederich Engels

### Introduction
{: .no_toc }

- Marx & Engles wrote *The Communist Manifesto* at ages 29 and 27; the work was published in February of 1848.
- Marx studied at the University of Berlin and took to the teachings of Hegel's master-slave dialectic.
- Progress through conflict.
- Marx later rejected the Young Hegelians for being insufficiently materialist and realist.
- Marx moved later into Paris. Marx considered himself to be a communist.
  - Socialism was considered to be more of a pacifist term (associations - Utopian schemes, idyllic dreams)
  - Communism - more of a militant word, revolutionary abolition of private property.
- Marx: "philosophers have hitherto merely interpreted the world in various ways; the point, however, is to change it."
- Manifesto was much ahead of its own time; a combination of German idealist philosophy, French socialist thougth, adn british classical economics.
- Four sections:
  1. Summarize political aspects of the materialist understanding of history. The unique age is characterized by antagonissm between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat.
  2. Marx and Engels explain that communists were not opposed to other working-class parties. Then, Marx & Engels deal with four common objections to communism.
  3. Mark out a distinctive doctrinal position for the Communist League by exposiing deficiencies of rival socialisms: the reactionary (Christian socialism, feudal socialism, the aristocracy), the bourgeois, the utopian.
  4. Deal with the attitude of communists to various opposition parties. A bit hastily written.
- Marx and Engels projected future tendencies they saw at work in the present.

### Introduction
{: .no_toc}

- The spectre of Communism. Old Europe has come together to hunt out the spectre.
- Communism is already acknowledged to be a power; communists should publish their views, aims, tendencies.

### 1. Bourgeois and Proletarians
{: .no_toc }

- The history of all existing society is the history of class struggles.
- The Hegelian dialectic: freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, oppressor and oppressed.
- The epoch of the bourgeoisie: class antagonisms have simplified into two great plants, the Bourgeoisie and the Proletariat.
- The manufacturing system has replaced the feudal or guild organization of industry.
- The modern bourgeoisie is itself a long course of development, revolutions in production and exchange.
- The modern state is a committee for managing the affairs of the bourgeoisie.
- The bourgeoisie has put an end to all feudal, patriarchal, and idyllic relationships whenever it has gotten the upper hand.
  - Resolved personal worth into exchange value
  - The single freedom of Free Trade over all other freedoms
  - Every occupation is a wage-laborer.
  - The family is a relationship between money.
- The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionizing the instruments of production, the relations of production, and the relations of society.
  - Conservation of old modes was the first condition of existence.
- The bourgeois epoch - constant revolutionizing of production.

> All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses, his real conditions of life, and his relations with his kind.

- The need of a constantly expanding market chases the bourgeoisie over the globe. It must be everywhere.
- Exploitation of the world - intercourse in every direction, universal interdependence.
- Control of production $$\to$$ intellectual production. Intellectual creations of individual nations become common property.
- World literature arises, narrow-mindedness becomes more impossible.
- The bourgeoisie facilitate the transofmration of even the most barbarian nations into civilized ones.
- Countries are subject to the rule of towns.
- Doing more away with scattered p'opulations - populations are agglomerated, production is centralized.
- The bourgeoisie has barely ruled for 100 years, but has created large productive forces.
- Feudal society collapsed, free competition emerged as dominant.
- The sorcerer that is no longer able to control the powers.
- The epidemic of overproduction: society is put back into a state of barbarism, famine, devastation - too much civilization, too much industry, too much commerce, too many means of subsistence.
- The productive forces become too powerful for the conditions by which they came about.
- How does the bourgeoisie overcome these crises? Enforced destruction oor conquest of new markets.
- The bourgeoisie felled feudalism with weapons that are now turned back on the bourgeoisie.
- Laborers must sell themselves like a commodity. The modern working class live only so long as they find work.
- The work of proletarians has lost all individual character; the workman has lost the charm.
- The price of a commodity is equal to its cost of production.
- As the repulsiveness of the work increases, the wage decreases.
- Laborers are organized like soldiers. A perfect hierarchy of officers and sergeants is organized. Enslaved by the machine, the overlooker, the bourgeois manufacturer. 
- Differences of age and sex have no distinctive social avalidity for the working class.
- All lower strata sink into the proletariat.
- The proletariat's development
  1. Struggle with the bourgeoisie
  2. Laborers contest the individual bourgeois.
  3. Attacks are directed not only against the conditions of production, but the instruments of production themselves.
- If laborers unit to form more compact bodies (unions), it is as a result of the union of the bourgeoisie.
- Proletarians fight enemies of enemies - monarchy, land-owners, non-industrial bourgeoisie.
  - All of history is concentrated in the control of the bourgeoisie.
- With the development of industry, the proletariat grows stronger. Collisions between individuals become collisions between two classes. Workers club together to form combinations against the bourgeois.
  - Workers are sometimes victorious, but only sometimes. The real fruit of battles is in the expanding union of workers.
  - Every class struggle is a political struggle.
  - Organization of proletarians into a class and political party: often upset by internal competition, but always rises up again. Collisions between classes of the old society further the development of the proletariat.
- The bourgeoisie is in constant battle. It must always somehow convince and furnish the proletariat.
- The proletariat alone is a really revolutionary class. Other classes decya and disapear; the proletariat is an essential product.
- Many fight against the brougeoisie to save their existence from extinction; they are not revolutionary but conservative, reactionary.
- The proletarian is without property; they cannot become masters except by abolishing the previous mode of appropriation.
- All previous historical movements were movements in the interest of minorities; the proletarian movement is the interest of the immense majority.
- Every form of society is based on the antagonism of oppressing and oppressed classes.
- Certain conditions must be assured to oppress a class to continue its slavish existence. The serf raised himself to membership in the commune, just as the bourgeois developed into a bourgeois.
- The modern laborer sinks deeper below the conditions of existence instead of rising with the progress.
- The bourgeoisie is unfit to rule because it cannot assure an existence to its slave within slavery. 
- Essential condition for exsitence is wealth accumulation, capital, and wage labor. Wage labor rests exclusively on competition between laborers.
- The bourgeoisie produces its own gravediggers; the proletariat's rise is as inevitable as the fall of the bourgeoisie.

### 2. Proletarians and Communists
{: .no_toc }

- Communists do not form a separate party opposed to other working-class parties; they do not have any separate principles; they point out common interests ot eh proletariat independent of nationality. Represents whole interests.
- Communists aim to form the proletariat into a class, overthrow bourgeois supremacy, and conquer proletarian political power.
- The Communiss only express true relations, rather than discovered or invented ideas.
- All property relations of the past have been subject to constant historical replacement. Communism is not distinctive in advocating for the abolishmnet of property relations, but rather the abolition of bourgeois - private - property.
- Common objection: Communists abolish the right of personally acquiring property as the fruit of one's own labor.
  - The property of the petty bourgeois and the small peasant are already destroyed by industry.
  - Wage labor creates no proprerty for the laborer; it creates capital. Property is based on the antagonism of capital and wage labor.
- Capitalists: not merely a personal but a social status in production. Capital is inherently a collective product. Capital is not personal, it is social.
- When capital is converted into common property, capital becomes more true to its formation and being.
- In bourgeois society, living labor is a means to increase accumulated labor. In a Communist society, accumulated labor enriches the existence of the laborer.
- Under bourgeois conditions of production, freedom means free trade. If selling and buying disappear, though, free trade disappears too.
- Argument: when individual property can no longer be transformed into bourgeois property, individuality vanishes.
  - Counter: the individual here is the bourgeois, the middle-class owner of property; these people must be swept 'out of the way'.
- Communism deprives no man of the power to appropriate products of society, only to prevent the power to control the labor of others via such appropriation.
- Argument: the abolition of private property breeds idleness and laziness.
  - Counterargument: In bourgeois socieyt, those that work acquire nothing and those that do not work acquiring everything. There can no longer be any wage labor when there is no longer any capital. 
- To the bourgeois, the disappearance of class property is the disappearance of production itself.
- The modern family is premised upon capital and private gain. Abolition of the family.
  - The bourgeois sees only production in his wife.
- Geopolitical tensions will resolve when class tensions are resolved.
- Charges against Communism made from an ideological standpoint are not deserving of serious examination. Man's consciousness changes with every change in the conditions of his existence.
- Myth of the eternal truth
- Exploitation of one part of society by the other.
- Communist revolution ruptures traditional peoprerty relations.
- The first step in revolution is to win the battle of democracy. Political power must be used to wrest capital from the bourgeoisie and to centralize instruments of production in the proletariat organized as the ruling class (the State).
  - This must be carried out first via 'despotic inroads' on property and the condiitons of bourgeois production.
- Measures:
  1. Expropriation of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes
  2. A heavy progressive tax
  3. Abolition of inheritance rights
  4. Confiscation of the property of emigrants and rebels
  5. Centralization of all capital in the State
  6. Centralization of all transport in the State
  7. Extensions to instruments of production owned by the State
  8. Equal liability of all to labor
  9. Combination of agriculture with industry
  10. Free education for all children
- When class distinctions have disappeared and production is concentrated in individuals, public power loses its political character. Political power is merely the power to oppress. 
- If the proletariat makes itself the ruling class, it will sweep away the conditions of existence for class antagonisms and of classes itself. *Therefore, it will have abolished its own supremacy as a class.*
- A world without classes or class antagonisms: rather, free development of each and for all.

### 3. Socialist and Communist Literature
{: .no_toc }


Feudal Socialism
- The aristocracy are obliged to demonstrate forgetfulness of their own interests.
- Aristocracy took revenge.
- Feudal Socialism: half lamentation, half lampoon, half echo of the past, half menace of the future.
- Feudal Socialism is always ludicrous in its effect.
- Feudalists forget that feudalism was exploited under different and 'antiquated' conditions.
- The modern bourgeoisie is the offspring of their own form of society.
- The bourgeoisie creates not merely a proletariat, but a revolutionary proletariat.
- Clerical Socialism with Feudal Socialism: hand-in-hand.
- Christian ascetism can be easily given a Socialist tinge.

> "Christian Socialism" is but the holy water with which the priest consecrates the heart-burnings of the aristocrat."

Petty-Bourgeois Socialism
- The feudal aristocracy was not the only class ruined by the bourgeoisie.
- Medieval burgesses and the small peasant proprieters - precursors of the modern bourgeoisie. 
- The petty bourgeois fluctuates betweent he proletariat and the bourgeoisie; it renews itself as supplementary to bourgeois society.
- Petty-bourgeois Socialism: writers who sided with the proletariat against the bourgeoisie should use the standard of the peasant and petty bourgeois. 
- Petty-Bourgeois socialism dissects contradictions in the conditions of modern productions.
- However, it attempts to restore the old means of production or to 'cramp' modern means of production within the framework of old property relationships. It is either reactionary or Utopian. 

> "In its further development, this trend ended in a cowardly fit of the blues."

German, or "'True'", Socialism
- German philosophers and thinkers developed upon French Socialist and Communist literature. 
- To 18th century German philosophers the first French Revolution represented the demands of Practial Reason and pure Will.
- German literati brought new French ideas into harmony with ancient philosophical conscience.
- Appropriation via translation
- French Socialist and Communist literature was completely emasculated. 
- To presrve the petty-bourgoeis class is to preserve the existing state of things in Germany. 'True Socialism' 'solved' the threat of industrail supremacy of the bourgeoisie and the rise of the revolutionary proletariat.
