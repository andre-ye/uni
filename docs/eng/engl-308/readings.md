## *The Communist Manifesto* by Karl Marx and Frederich Engels

### Introduction
{: .no_toc }

- Marx & Engles wrote *The Communist Manifesto* at ages 29 and 27; the work was published in February of 1848.
- Marx studied at the University of Berlin and took to the teachings of Hegel's master-slave dialectic.
- Progress through conflict.
- Marx later rejected the Young Hegelians for being insufficiently materialist and realist.
- Marx moved later into Paris. Marx considered himself to be a communist.
  - Socialism was considered to be more of a pacifist term (associations - Utopian schemes, idyllic dreams)
  - Communism - more of a militant word, revolutionary abolition of private property.
- Marx: "philosophers have hitherto merely interpreted the world in various ways; the point, however, is to change it."
- Manifesto was much ahead of its own time; a combination of German idealist philosophy, French socialist thougth, adn british classical economics.
- Four sections:
  1. Summarize political aspects of the materialist understanding of history. The unique age is characterized by antagonissm between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat.
  2. Marx and Engels explain that communists were not opposed to other working-class parties. Then, Marx & Engels deal with four common objections to communism.
  3. Mark out a distinctive doctrinal position for the Communist League by exposiing deficiencies of rival socialisms: the reactionary (Christian socialism, feudal socialism, the aristocracy), the bourgeois, the utopian.
  4. Deal with the attitude of communists to various opposition parties. A bit hastily written.
- Marx and Engels projected future tendencies they saw at work in the present.

### Introduction
{: .no_toc}

- The spectre of Communism. Old Europe has come together to hunt out the spectre.
- Communism is already acknowledged to be a power; communists should publish their views, aims, tendencies.

### 1. Bourgeois and Proletarians
{: .no_toc }

- The history of all existing society is the history of class struggles.
- The Hegelian dialectic: freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, oppressor and oppressed.
- The epoch of the bourgeoisie: class antagonisms have simplified into two great plants, the Bourgeoisie and the Proletariat.
- The manufacturing system has replaced the feudal or guild organization of industry.
- The modern bourgeoisie is itself a long course of development, revolutions in production and exchange.
- The modern state is a committee for managing the affairs of the bourgeoisie.
- The bourgeoisie has put an end to all feudal, patriarchal, and idyllic relationships whenever it has gotten the upper hand.
  - Resolved personal worth into exchange value
  - The single freedom of Free Trade over all other freedoms
  - Every occupation is a wage-laborer.
  - The family is a relationship between money.
- The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionizing the instruments of production, the relations of production, and the relations of society.
  - Conservation of old modes was the first condition of existence.
- The bourgeois epoch - constant revolutionizing of production.

> All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses, his real conditions of life, and his relations with his kind.

- The need of a constantly expanding market chases the bourgeoisie over the globe. It must be everywhere.
- Exploitation of the world - intercourse in every direction, universal interdependence.
- Control of production $$\to$$ intellectual production. Intellectual creations of individual nations become common property.
- World literature arises, narrow-mindedness becomes more impossible.
- The bourgeoisie facilitate the transofmration of even the most barbarian nations into civilized ones.
- Countries are subject to the rule of towns.
- Doing more away with scattered p'opulations - populations are agglomerated, production is centralized.
- The bourgeoisie has barely ruled for 100 years, but has created large productive forces.
- Feudal society collapsed, free competition emerged as dominant.
- The sorcerer that is no longer able to control the powers.
- The epidemic of overproduction: society is put back into a state of barbarism, famine, devastation - too much civilization, too much industry, too much commerce, too many means of subsistence.
- The productive forces become too powerful for the conditions by which they came about.
- How does the bourgeoisie overcome these crises? Enforced destruction oor conquest of new markets.
- The bourgeoisie felled feudalism with weapons that are now turned back on the bourgeoisie.
- Laborers must sell themselves like a commodity. The modern working class live only so long as they find work.
- The work of proletarians has lost all individual character; the workman has lost the charm.
- The price of a commodity is equal to its cost of production.
- As the repulsiveness of the work increases, the wage decreases.
- Laborers are organized like soldiers. A perfect hierarchy of officers and sergeants is organized. Enslaved by the machine, the overlooker, the bourgeois manufacturer. 
- Differences of age and sex have no distinctive social avalidity for the working class.
- All lower strata sink into the proletariat.
- The proletariat's development
  1. Struggle with the bourgeoisie
  2. Laborers contest the individual bourgeois.
  3. Attacks are directed not only against the conditions of production, but the instruments of production themselves.
- If laborers unit to form more compact bodies (unions), it is as a result of the union of the bourgeoisie.
- Proletarians fight enemies of enemies - monarchy, land-owners, non-industrial bourgeoisie.
  - All of history is concentrated in the control of the bourgeoisie.
- With the development of industry, the proletariat grows stronger. Collisions between individuals become collisions between two classes. Workers club together to form combinations against the bourgeois.
  - Workers are sometimes victorious, but only sometimes. The real fruit of battles is in the expanding union of workers.
  - Every class struggle is a political struggle.
  - Organization of proletarians into a class and political party: often upset by internal competition, but always rises up again. Collisions between classes of the old society further the development of the proletariat.
- The bourgeoisie is in constant battle. It must always somehow convince and furnish the proletariat.
- The proletariat alone is a really revolutionary class. Other classes decya and disapear; the proletariat is an essential product.
- Many fight against the brougeoisie to save their existence from extinction; they are not revolutionary but conservative, reactionary.
- The proletarian is without property; they cannot become masters except by abolishing the previous mode of appropriation.
- All previous historical movements were movements in the interest of minorities; the proletarian movement is the interest of the immense majority.
- Every form of society is based on the antagonism of oppressing and oppressed classes.
- Certain conditions must be assured to oppress a class to continue its slavish existence. The serf raised himself to membership in the commune, just as the bourgeois developed into a bourgeois.
- The modern laborer sinks deeper below the conditions of existence instead of rising with the progress.
- The bourgeoisie is unfit to rule because it cannot assure an existence to its slave within slavery. 
- Essential condition for exsitence is wealth accumulation, capital, and wage labor. Wage labor rests exclusively on competition between laborers.
- The bourgeoisie produces its own gravediggers; the proletariat's rise is as inevitable as the fall of the bourgeoisie.

### 2. Proletarians and Communists
{: .no_toc }

- Communists do not form a separate party opposed to other working-class parties; they do not have any separate principles; they point out common interests ot eh proletariat independent of nationality. Represents whole interests.
- Communists aim to form the proletariat into a class, overthrow bourgeois supremacy, and conquer proletarian political power.
- The Communiss only express true relations, rather than discovered or invented ideas.
- All property relations of the past have been subject to constant historical replacement. Communism is not distinctive in advocating for the abolishmnet of property relations, but rather the abolition of bourgeois - private - property.
- Common objection: Communists abolish the right of personally acquiring property as the fruit of one's own labor.
  - The property of the petty bourgeois and the small peasant are already destroyed by industry.
  - Wage labor creates no proprerty for the laborer; it creates capital. Property is based on the antagonism of capital and wage labor.
- Capitalists: not merely a personal but a social status in production. Capital is inherently a collective product. Capital is not personal, it is social.
- When capital is converted into common property, capital becomes more true to its formation and being.
- In bourgeois society, living labor is a means to increase accumulated labor. In a Communist society, accumulated labor enriches the existence of the laborer.
- Under bourgeois conditions of production, freedom means free trade. If selling and buying disappear, though, free trade disappears too.
- Argument: when individual property can no longer be transformed into bourgeois property, individuality vanishes.
  - Counter: the individual here is the bourgeois, the middle-class owner of property; these people must be swept 'out of the way'.
- Communism deprives no man of the power to appropriate products of society, only to prevent the power to control the labor of others via such appropriation.
- Argument: the abolition of private property breeds idleness and laziness.
  - Counterargument: In bourgeois socieyt, those that work acquire nothing and those that do not work acquiring everything. There can no longer be any wage labor when there is no longer any capital. 
- To the bourgeois, the disappearance of class property is the disappearance of production itself.
- The modern family is premised upon capital and private gain. Abolition of the family.
  - The bourgeois sees only production in his wife.
- Geopolitical tensions will resolve when class tensions are resolved.
- Charges against Communism made from an ideological standpoint are not deserving of serious examination. Man's consciousness changes with every change in the conditions of his existence.
- Myth of the eternal truth
- Exploitation of one part of society by the other.
- Communist revolution ruptures traditional peoprerty relations.
- The first step in revolution is to win the battle of democracy. Political power must be used to wrest capital from the bourgeoisie and to centralize instruments of production in the proletariat organized as the ruling class (the State).
  - This must be carried out first via 'despotic inroads' on property and the condiitons of bourgeois production.
- Measures:
  1. Expropriation of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes
  2. A heavy progressive tax
  3. Abolition of inheritance rights
  4. Confiscation of the property of emigrants and rebels
  5. Centralization of all capital in the State
  6. Centralization of all transport in the State
  7. Extensions to instruments of production owned by the State
  8. Equal liability of all to labor
  9. Combination of agriculture with industry
  10. Free education for all children
- When class distinctions have disappeared and production is concentrated in individuals, public power loses its political character. Political power is merely the power to oppress. 
- If the proletariat makes itself the ruling class, it will sweep away the conditions of existence for class antagonisms and of classes itself. *Therefore, it will have abolished its own supremacy as a class.*
- A world without classes or class antagonisms: rather, free development of each and for all.

### 3. Socialist and Communist Literature
{: .no_toc }


Feudal Socialism
- The aristocracy are obliged to demonstrate forgetfulness of their own interests.
- Aristocracy took revenge.
- Feudal Socialism: half lamentation, half lampoon, half echo of the past, half menace of the future.
- Feudal Socialism is always ludicrous in its effect.
- Feudalists forget that feudalism was exploited under different and 'antiquated' conditions.
- The modern bourgeoisie is the offspring of their own form of society.
- The bourgeoisie creates not merely a proletariat, but a revolutionary proletariat.
- Clerical Socialism with Feudal Socialism: hand-in-hand.
- Christian ascetism can be easily given a Socialist tinge.

> "Christian Socialism" is but the holy water with which the priest consecrates the heart-burnings of the aristocrat."

Petty-Bourgeois Socialism
- The feudal aristocracy was not the only class ruined by the bourgeoisie.
- Medieval burgesses and the small peasant proprieters - precursors of the modern bourgeoisie. 
- The petty bourgeois fluctuates betweent he proletariat and the bourgeoisie; it renews itself as supplementary to bourgeois society.
- Petty-bourgeois Socialism: writers who sided with the proletariat against the bourgeoisie should use the standard of the peasant and petty bourgeois. 
- Petty-Bourgeois socialism dissects contradictions in the conditions of modern productions.
- However, it attempts to restore the old means of production or to 'cramp' modern means of production within the framework of old property relationships. It is either reactionary or Utopian. 

> "In its further development, this trend ended in a cowardly fit of the blues."

German, or "'True'", Socialism
- German philosophers and thinkers developed upon French Socialist and Communist literature. 
- To 18th century German philosophers the first French Revolution represented the demands of Practial Reason and pure Will.
- German literati brought new French ideas into harmony with ancient philosophical conscience.
- Appropriation via translation
- French Socialist and Communist literature was completely emasculated. 
- To presrve the petty-bourgoeis class is to preserve the existing state of things in Germany. 'True Socialism' 'solved' the threat of industrail supremacy of the bourgeoisie and the rise of the revolutionary proletariat.
- The German nation is marked as the dieal nation, the German man as the ideal of man.
- Most so-called Socialist and Communist publishing in German "belong to the domain of this foul and enervating literature"

Conservative, or Bourgeois, Socialism
- To continue the existence of bourgeois society, the bourgeois attempt to redress social grievances.
- These are the likes of: economists, philanthropists, humanitarians, charity, etc.
- Proudhon - *Philosophie de la Misere*
- The Socialistic bourgeois want to improve the living conditions of modern society without struggle, to preserve the world as it is without revolution and disintegration.
- The world in which the bourgeoisie is supreme is presumed to be the best.
- A more practical but less systematic form of Bourgeois Socalism: depreciate all reform from the working class by showing that no political reform could be advantageous.

Crticial-Utopian Socialism and Communism
- Attempts of the proletariat to attain their own ends initially fail. 
- Revolutionary literature produced in the first steps of the proletariat has a necessarily reactionary character.
- The development of class antagonisms runs parallel with the development of industry. 
- Future history resolves itself into propaganda and execution of social plans.
- The undeveloped state of class struggle causes Socailists of this kind to consider themselves superior to all class antagonisms, and want to improve the condition of all - including the ruling class.
- Attempt to attain ends via peaceful means and small experimetns doomed for failure.
- Utopian character of proposals: point to the disappearance of class antagonisms that are just emerging and undefined.
- Utopain socialism is compelled to appeal to the feelings and purses of the bourgeois; this brand of socialism sinks into reactionary conservative socialism.

### 4. Position of the Communists in Relation to the Various Existing Opposition Parties
{: .no_toc }

- Communists fight for immediate and future aims.
- The Communists turn attention to Germany; this country is on the eve of a bourgeois revolution.
- Communists everywhere support the revolutionary movement against the existing social and political order.

### Preface to the English Edition of 1888
{: .no_toc }

- Parisian insurrection of June 1848 - defeated, political spirations of the European working class driven underground.
- Cologne Communist trial 
- International Working Men's Association. Welding the militant proletariat of Europe and America together.
- Trust in the intellectual development of the working class.
- English translations into America; the *Manifesto* has obtained international recognition. 
- It could not be called the/a *Socialist* Manifesto; the Socialists were Utopians and dying.
- Communism - militant, unsatisfied with mere political resolutions.
- Socialism - respectable, middle-class movement.
- In every historical epoch, the prevailing mode of economic and exchange  form the basis of that epoch's political and intellectual history.
- The pattern of oppression from epoch to epoch has developed such thtat the proletariat cannot be emancipated without emancipating society at large.
- The proposition of the *Communist Manifesto* will do for history what Darwin's theory of evolution has done for biology.
- Quotation from the German edition

> "But then, the manifesto has become a historical document which we have no longer any right to alter."

### Preface to the German Edition of 1890
{: .no_toc }

- An updated German edition of the Manifesto has become necessary.
- The Russian, Polish, Danish, French, Spanish versions have been published.
- Inaccurate translations had been repeatedly reprinted in England; Samuel Moore printed an authentic version.
- The International Working Men's Association
- The history of the Manifesto reflects the history of the modern working-class movement.
- Socialists - considered to be Utopians or social 'quacks' attempting to eliminate social abuses through patchwork without hurting capital and profit. 
- The emancipation of the workers must be the act of the working class itself - and thus Communism was chosen, rather than Socialism.
- "Working men, unite!" Few responded, but later the proletarians of most Western European countries unified through the IWMA.

### Preface to the Polish Edition of 1872
{: .no_toc }
- A polish edition has become necessary.
- The Manifesto has become an index of the development of large-scale industry.
- A Polish edition indicates progress of Polish industry.
- Poland has, throughout history, been hung out to dry; the workers of Europe need the independence of Poland as much as the Polish workers themselves.

## "Theses Concerning Feuerbach" by Marx
- All hitherto existing materialism has considered the object's form, but not human activity or subjectively.
- Feuerbach wants sensuous objects distinct from thought objectives but does not consider human activity to be objective.
- Can objective truth be attributed to human thinking? A practical, rather than theoretical question.
- Materialist doctrine: understanding the changing of circumstances. The educator must be educated himself.
- Sensuousness is not considered to be practical.
- Human essence is not inherent to individuals, but an ensemble of social relations.
- All social life is practical. The rational solution is always found in human practice.
- Contemplative materialism that does not believe sensuousness as practical contemplates single individuals and civil society.
- Standpoint of old materialism: civil soceity. Standpoint of the new materialism: human society, social humanity.

> "The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point is to *change* it."

## "Bartleby, The Scrivener: A Story of Wall-street" by Melville
- Bartleby - the strangest scrivener; nothing is ascertainable.
- Narrator - soft, safe, prudent. The easiest way of life is the best.
- Turkey - a short, pursy, old Englishman. Eccentricities overlooked in favor of usefulness to the narrator. 
- Nippers - whiskered, sallow, piratical, young. An annoyance to the narrator.
- Ginger Nut - twelve years old. Quick-witted . An errand boy.
- Bartleby - did an extraordinary amount of writin; no pause. Then; he refused work - "I would prefer not to".
- The themes of "passive defiance", negative preference, remaning but not providing the means to remain
- An existence without labor is an existence that cannot be comprehended by almost anyone.
- Binarization of the means of labor - one works, or one does not work. One quits, or stays.
- Authority and enforcement.
- Government as a monopoly on violence.

## "The Ideological Tensions of Capitlaism: Universalism versus Racism and Sexism" by Wallerstein
- Universalist doctrine - "the brotherhood of man".
  - Yet this emblem of universalism itself is gendered, implicit exclusive of females. 
- Universalism is so widely shared - but why do racism and sexism still persist?
- **Paradox.** The major challenge to racism and sexism has been universalist beliefs, and the major challenge to universalism has been racist and sexist beliefs. *Most of us find it plausible to pursue both simultaneously.*
  - An enduring, widespread, structural paradox.
- Previous history: no universalism, prioritization of a clearly demarcated insider over a clearly demarcated outsider, rather than abiding by abstract ideas about *the* human species, etc.
- Two ways of explaining the oirings of universalism as an ideology. 
  - Universalism is a culmination of an older intellectual tradition.
  - Universalism is an idea particularly appropriate to a capitalist world-economy.
- Moral leap from the recognition of tribal gods to the unicity of God (and the implicit unity of humanity). 
- Modern Enlightenmnet derived moral equality and human rights from human nature itself - rights are naturally assumed rather than earned.
- Previously excluded groups have been explicitly included into universalist doctrine. 
- Capitalist world economy as built upon the endless accumulation of capital. Commodification of everything. (Refer - Marx, *The Communist Manifesto*.)
- Anything that prevents goods, capital, or labor from being a marketable commodity restrains flows; "particularisms of any kind" challenge the logic of capitalist social relations.
- We have developed a system of institutions around meritocracy. It is said that meritocracy is economically efficient and politically stabilizing.
  - Inequalities in the distribution of reward are argued to result from differences in merit. 
- A meritocracy is a politically very unstable system - this political fragility allows racism and sexism to enter the picture.
- Race and gender inequalities have increased in the modern world, correlative with the rise of universalist doctrine.
- Racism is not merely disdain as defined by genetic or social criteria.
  - Xenophobia in history: we obtain purity of society by ejecting the barbarian, but lose their labor popwer.
  - A capitalist system needs all labor; ejection is pointless. To maximize capital accumulation, minimize the cost of production and political disruption. Racism is the 'magic formula' for this.
  - Racism as an ideology: Bartolome de Las Casas argued Indians had souls, they were humans, and the ruels of natural law applied to them. Now, they would form the bottom layer of the work hierarchy.
  - Racism - the 'ethnicization' of the work force.
  - Racism allows for boundaries of the past to be combined with present boundaries to hierarchically rank groups.
  - Accomplishes three things:
    1. One can expand or contract the 'numbers available' to the bottom class
    2. One can constantly recreate social communities that socialize children into playing suitable roles
    3. One can justify capitalism with a non-meritocratic basis.
- Racism begets sexism - the two are linked. The ethnicization of the work force exists to permit very low wages; low wages are possible because lifetime wage income provides a small amount of total household income.
- Labor input to non-wage work by women - 'compensates' the lowness of wage income. Sexism allows us not to think about low wages. The role of women in society creates surplus value for the owners of capital.
- Ageism - we presume that the housewife's work does not create surplus value; neither do the work inputs for the old and young.
- Universalism-meritocracy: the method by which the system can be legitimized; racism-sexism serving to structure most of the work force.
- When racism-sexism goes too far, they are resisted by the victims and economic forces.
- Universalism cannot go too far because it can only be accomplished slowly and is easy to resist. One may denounce it as 'reverse racism'.
- Capitalism operates by a tense link between universalism and racism-sexism; there is always tension, always swinging from one side to the other. 
- Over time, the pendulum swings more and more extreme. Accumulation of historical experience. (Marx and the culmination into the victory of the proletariat?)
- "Our" task: to invent new systems that use neither the ideology of universalism nor of racism-sexism.

## "Class Conflict in the Capitalist World-Economy" by Immanuel Wallerstein
- Marx did not invent social class; the greeks knew about it.
- Marx made key three contributions.
  1. All history is a history of class struggle.
  2. A class an sich is not necessarily a class fur sich (implicit vs explicit).
  3. The fundamental conflict of capitalism is between the owners and non-owners, rather than the productiv enad non-productive sectors.
- Weber: argued that class was only one of three dimensions among which groups are formed (other two - status and ideology).
- Social psychologists: the only meaningful construct is a 'subjective' one, in which class membership is determined by thought.
- Analysts: polarization diminished over time - more than two classes exist.
- Question: how to interpret Marxist premises. 
- What are the political consequences of the ways both the bourgeoisie and the proletariat have fit into the capitalist labor division?
- What is capitalism as a mode of production? Capitalist is the only mode of production in which the maximization of surplus creation is rewarded. The market is a structure, but not an institution. Surplus is maximized for its own sake. The pressure is for constant exapnsion.
- Capitalism rewards re-investment into itself, rather than consumption.
- Those who do not accumulate capital, but merely consume surplus, lose out economically.
- Bourgeoisie: those that receive part of the surplus value they do not create and use it to accumulate capital.
- The bourgeoisie is not a static phenoemnon.
- If we accept there is no ideal type of a bourgeoisie or a proletariat, we must deifne classes in terms of processes. One becomes a bourgeois by achievement in the market, but even more significantly by inheritance.
- Stauts - fossilization of past achievement rewards.
- Three segments of thed bourgeousie - the noveaux riches, the coasters, and the descendants. The third is the largest by far, the source of stability in the bourgeois class.
- Intra-bourgeois conflict between the progressive and reactionary groups. The largest segment of the bourgeoisie have both privilege in class and status terms, and do not los from either of the definitions. These conflicts shake up the system.
- Proletariat - those who yield part of the value they have created to others. The polarity here is structural; one must take what they have not created for reinvestment or yield it to others for reinvestment.
- Eight sorts of workers: the classic worker, the petty producers, the tenant farmer, the sharecropper, the peon, the slave.
- Wage labor is probably the most highly paid forms of labor. Thus, wage labor has never been the exclusive form of labor.
- Capitalism has contradictions: what is profitable in the short run is not necessarily profitable in the long run. 
- Proletarianization - increasing percentage of wage labor.
- At a certain level of income and rights, the proletarian becomes the bourgeois. 
- The role of the state in capitalism. State: to augment the advantage of some against others in the market - to reduce the freedom of the market. Transfer income; market restriction; restraining.
- A state's sovereignty is a claim to the monopolization of violence.
- Many bourgeois share the surplus value of one proletarian.
- The transfer of surplus value crosses national boundaries. 
- States are the primary arena of political conflict in a capitalist world economy.
- Capitalism is a system in which the surplus value of the proletarian is appropriated by the bourgeois.
- Concepts of - core, semiperiphery, periphery.

## "What is Owed" by Nicole Hannah-Jones
Access [here](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/06/24/magazine/reparations-slavery.html) (link: `https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/06/24/magazine/reparations-slavery.html`).

- Black uprisings swept the United States in the mid-1960s; Johnson created the Kerner Commission. Americans voted a 'law and order' president - Nixon - who halted that work.
- Swift developments: George Floyd, Black Lives matter, 
- Multigenerational protest army. 
- COVID-19 and awareness of racialized class divide

> "The names of the mechanisms of social control have changed, but the presumption that white patrollers have the legal right to kill black people deemed to have committed minor infractions or to have breached the social order has remained."

- To fully address inequality, we must get to the root of it.
- Lack of wealth has defined post-slavery black life. Wealth is the means to security in America.
- Poll taxes - rules and policies involving money can effectively enforce segregation.
- Black Americans with high incomes are still black and face discrimination due to lack of intergenerational wealth.
- Today's racism was conjured centuries ago to justify generation of capital from black people.
- The white planter class earned their living from free black labor and with products produced from slave labor.
- Slavery and racial apartheid as economic exploitation
- Reconstruction as America's second founding.
- Education and contemporary narratives of slavery. Parchment rights vs - conditions of economics and sustinence.
- Black people - the only race in the US to ever start out as an entire people with near 0 capital.
- Many white American families descend from homesteaders.
- Incalculable destruction of black property and life in the 1900s.
- Many public policies provided white Americans with tools to advance social welfare.
- The civil rights movement ended white advantage by law; changing laws marks the end of obligation.
- Legislation stopped further sanctioned explicit damage, but did not repair a history of sanctioned and explicit damage.
- King is misquoted and misunderstood by white Americans seeking to weave convenient and somewhat shallow narratives.
- Americans are unaware about the persistence of racial economic inequality in the US.
- The racial wealth gap and questions of responsibility.
- The ability to purchase a first home is seldom the result of hard work and wise spending.
- Wealth begets wealth.
- Reparations can be used to remedy the racial wealth chasm.

> "Reparations are not about punishing white Americans, and white Americans are not the ones who would pay for them. It does not matter if your ancestors engaged in slavery or if you just immigrated here two weeks ago. Reparations are a societal obligation in a nation where our Constitution sanctioned slavery, Congress passed laws protecting it and our federal government initiated, condoned and practiced legal racial segregation and discrimination against black Americans until half a century ago. And so it is the federal government that pays."

- Congress allocates money to support Holocaust survivors, but refused to pass H.R. 40 - a bill to simply study reparations.
- Has the coronavirus changed things? It has dug up what is hiding beneath.

> "If black lives are to truly matter in America, this nation must move beyond slogans and symbolism. Citizens don’t inherit just the glory of their nation, but its wrongs too. A truly great country does not ignore or excuse its sins. It confronts them and then works to make them right. If we are to be redeemed, if we are to live up to the magnificent ideals upon which we were founded, we must do what is just. It is time for this country to pay its debt. It is time for reparations."

## "Racial Capitalism" by Melamed
- Three conditions: primitive accumulation, ideologies of capitlaist rationality (individualism, liberalism, democracy), new activisms.
- 'Racial capitalism' - capitalism is racial capitalism. Capital can only accumulate by exploiting severe inequalities between human groups.
- Racialized material and epistemic violence: executed by core capitalist states.
- Accumulation under capitalism: necessary exproporiation of labor, land, resoources.
- Understanding 'racial capitlaism' as a product of social separateness; technology of antirelationality.
- Ideas of democracy, nationalism, and multiculturalism: key to racial capitalist processes of differentiation. People are differentiated into a collective existence via democracy and nationalism; groups are minoritized and homogenized via multiculturalism.
  - Identitarianism - obscuring shifting power and instability of social relations.
- The capitalism Marx wrote about was already racial capitalism.
- The hallmark of racial capitalism: dense connection between manufacturing and social separateness.Symbiotic development of colonialism and the credit system - Marx. 
  - The flow of capital is purified
- Failure in Marx's text: Marx finds value to be a pharmekon, a simultaneous poison and medicine. Imposition of value everywhere motivates rationalism, Eurocentrism, reductive materialism, developmentalism.
- Neoliberalism and rapaciousness for natural resources: ties itself to indigeneity.

- Having a wage means inclusion in the social contract.
- Housework has become naturalized upon the female body and spirit.
- Assumption: housework is not work.
- Socialization and training by the unwaged mother to prepare girls into the roal.
- Illusion that women marry for love - most marry for money and security; and regardless the work is significant.
- Housework is denied a wwage and transformed into love.
- Leads to accumulation of free work, the disciplining of male workers by providing a servant - an Eve for an Adam.
- The poorer the family, the higher the enslavement of the woman. Capital acts differently for the middle class and for the working class.
- Bringing the battle of the wife out of the private and into the public.
- Fraud under the cover of love and marriage: housework is naturalized and sexualized, then becomes a feminine attribute.
  - This affects all women - even the unmarried and those with well-off husbands.

### The Revolutionary Perspective

- Forcing capital to restructure social relations in more favorable terms to women.
- The power of the wage can be used to demystify feminity and make feminity as work visible.

## "The Dialectics of Still Life: Murder, Women, and Disposability" by Wright

> Ambiguity is the pictorial image of dialectics, the law of dialectics seen at a standstill. This standstill is utopia and the dialectical image therefore a dream image. Such an image is presented 
by the pure commodity: as fetish. Such an image are the arcades, 
which are both house and stars. Such an image is the prostitute, 
who is saleswoman and wares in one. - Walter Benjamin, *Reflections*.

- Crime wave against women in Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua.
- Third world female disposability - factory production and urban violence.
- Walter Benjamin - the dialectical image. What is the disposability of the Mexican woman worker?
- Dialectical image: stillness obscures tensions that hold it in suspension, that keep it still.
- Mexican woman - still life caused by a waste-value dialectic.
- Mexican woman - variable capital fluctuating between value and waste. Labor power - producers value in excess to itself.
- Marx - labor power is variable capital because it is worth less than the value of what it produces.
- Labor power is worth less than the value of her labor.
- 'Turnover' - dynamics of workers in and out of jobs, worker unreliabiility.
- Gender distinguishes the untrainable and the trainable workers.
- Kinship between discourse and materiality: women are protrayed as untrainable. Value of Mexican women does not appreciate into skill, but instead disintegrates; value is used up rather than accumulated.
- The masculine subject is the other type of variable capital - the one that appreciates over time.
- Wasting of the Mexican woman
  - Value appreciates in what she is not
  - Her turnover incorporates flexibility into the labor supply

### The Murder Stories
{: .no_toc }

- Questions of murder victims: were they good girls?
- "foreign serial killer" - the murder is imported from external lands.
- Ciudad Juarez's social shock: erosion of 'traditional' values due to contact with liberal American soceity.
- Proposal: the problem is cultural climate.
  - Cultural declines anticipate death; cultural corrective against traditional values.
- "Death by culture" narrative points to internal cultural forces that give rise to deviancy.
- Femininity and wastedness: restore cultural values rather than seeking the perpetrators of crime.
- Male jealousy of feminine independence is identiifed as the primary reason behind crime. Notion that industry cannot do anything to stop the crime.
- Culture is used as justification for industry apathy. "invoking death by culture narrative to absolve the maquiladora industry of any implication in the violence"
- The odd configuration of the Mexican woman: roots in female sexuality, motherhood, work ethic. Physiognomy of the Mexican female form.
