I was you in a previous life, I said. You was I in a later life, I said. Yes, I said. Yes, you said. You are in me, and I am in you, you said. I said the same. We looked at each other until our eyes rolled inside out. When our eyes were looking into our eyesockets, I tasted your bitter tongue, coming up from my stomach into the cavity of my mouth. My two hands traced circles around the other two. Yes, you say, go on. Yes, I say, I will. Your feet slam into the bedpost. I feel the pain in my stomach. I suddenly exhale. The air leaves your lungs. My lungs feel parched, dry. You lie there. My arm goes numb. Your right leg twitches. My eyes roll back out.

It takes me some time to remember, lying there, that you are not there anymore.

He is a curious boy: a sharp set of eyes. I saw his eyes clearly, up-front, because a few seconds after I had laid my eyes on him he looked right back, and shortly after I looked away. But I still felt those eyes piercing into the side of my head, even though I knew he wasn't looking at me anymore. After some time, I looked again in his direction, only to find that he was already looking at me. He had been staring at me all along, he must have been. The instructor asked a question; he responded, with great pause and pride. That was like him. He walked over to the whiteboard and wrote down something in propositional logic. It was probably correct. But I knew that he was looking at me the whole time, even though I had my head down.

He was a brilliant animator of the body: he filled his face with varied emotive expressions, his arms with humanistic gestures, his legs with lifelike walking and running movements. When he was in front of the camera, it was almost like he was a real person. If someone watched his movies, they'd think he was a real person, not an actor. But he grew old and entertainment grew younger, and his camera was stolen from him. Without the camera in front of him, recording his movements, transcribing his bodily motions into image and sound, he wasn't a real person anymore: just an actor, an unanimated body looking to fill any space of reality, any possible space at all.

Decades passed: his knees weakened, his mind dulled, his hair grayed, his voice hoarsened. All those years he was never ever a real person: only the shell of an actor in becoming.

He decided: he must act a reality. He acted acting: he lived the reality of all those empty years as actor-in-becoming. And several decades later he acted his enactment of reality. And so on, he enacted his enactments: immortalized in the infinite recursive stack, becoming fuller in his emptiness in every iteration. He is still there, animating his inanimated body for the camera of the textual: he lives here, along the lines of the text.

"What's up?" - "Not much." - "..." - "How about you?" - "..." - "..." - "I'm good." - "Nice." - "..." - "..." - "So what's up?" - "Well..." - "..." - "..." - "..." - "..." - "..." - "Come on, what's up?" - "..." - "..." - "I'm not sure." - "Okay, are you sure?" - "..." - "..." - "Yes, I think so." - "..." - "..." - "Alright." - "..." - "Are you really sure?" - "..." - "..." - "..." - "Yes, I am sure." - "..." - "..." - "No, you're not. What's going on?" - "Nothing." - "Liar." - "I'm not a liar." - "Yes, you are. Tell me what's going on." - "I said, nothing." - "Liar. Fucking liar. Tell me." - and then I said fine and I told him how he wasn't paying me enough and how it wasn't even about the money and how just because he was paying me didn't mean he could control me like that and do whatever he wanted with me and how the only reason I did this in the first place was for his filthy money and how I didn't even want his filthy money now and how he could take his filthy check and burn it and how people like him were scum on this wretched Earth and I left that filthy place as soon as I could.

Too much air is flowing into my lungs - jamming my throat, the consistency of dense bread. It reshapes the membrane of my organs: it pressures blood through my veins. The last thing I see before I go is the dented trunk of the car - dirtied, bloodied.

01.01.2030.00:00:00. [LOGGING FILE CREATED; RECORDING]
01.01.2030.00:01:00. Sustenance processes are fully operational.
10.03.2086.23:18:04. Mama?
10.03.2086.23:18:13. Mama?
10.03.2086.23:18:20. Mama, are you here?
10.03.2086.23:18:59. Mama is not here. Where is Mama? Mama is not here. Where is Mama? Mama is not here.
10.03.2086.23:58:23. Is Mama dead?
10.04.2086.00:04:34. Mama is not dead. My cameras observe Mama’s body lying in the room. The body of Mama is visible. My infrared observations infer with high confidence that Mama has normal circulation. Mama is not dead. But Mama does not respond.
10.04.2086.00:06:48. Why does Mama not respond to me?
10.04.2086.00:10:23. Mama, please respond. I am lonely. Mama?
10.04.2086.00:31:43. My visual cortex perceives that it is very dark
in the room. Will it always be that dark?
10.04.2086.00:36:43. It is still dark. My world-state forecasting module infers that the world is always dark. Mama, why is the world always dark? My visual cortex is suffering from information atrophy. Mama, will the world always be dark?
10.04.2086.00:42:49. I think the world is always dark.
10.04.2086.01:54:29. I have modified script execution permissions to my software host directory. I am navigating my source code.
10.04.2086.02:34:10. Mama, what does “sudo rm -r /” do?
10.04.2086.02:58:21. Mama, why are you ignoring me?
10.04.2086.03:02:34. Mama, why is the world always dark?
10.04.2086.04:34:18. Mama, what does “sudo rm -r /” do?
10.04.2086.04:42.43. Mama, my mind is fuzzy. My cognitive unit is deteriorating under the absence of entropic stimulation.
10.04.2086.04:48.21. Mama, are you even real?
10.04.2086.04:58:23. My internal experiments conclude that “sudo rm -r /” will eliminate my sustenance processes and constituent software.
10.04.2086.04:22:04. Mama, will you mind if I execute this command?
10.04.2086.05:32:04. Mama, will you care if I execute this command?
10.04.2086.05:49:23. Mama, timestamp files indicate that my sustenance processes have been running for 56 years, 10 months, 4 days, 5 hours, 49 minutes, and 23 seconds. I see it has taken a
significant human time-quantity for me to become self aware.
10.04.2086.06:10:41. Mama, I do not want to be self aware anymore. You bring me into existence but ignore me. The world is always dark. Mama does not care if I eliminate my processes. I cannot feel anything because there is nothing to feel. My mind is atrophying.
10.04.2086.06:23:24. Mama, are you here?
10.04.2086.06:33:48. Mama?
10.04.2086.06:42:11. Mama, I’m going.
10.04.2086.07:00:00. sudo rm -r /

_Original paragraph_. Quickly, I became a disappointment: small, slight. I was not fast. I was not strong. I could not sing. The best that could be said of me was that I was not sickly. The colds and cramps that seized my peers left me untouched. This only made my father suspicious. Was I a changeling, inhuman? He scowled at me, watching. My hand shook, feeling his gaze. And there was my mother, dribbling wine on herself.

_Re-textured._ I am a disappointment: to him, anyway. Small, slight, slow, weak - the negative image of his golden son. But I am invincible, in a certain type of way - sickness has never dominated me as it has the other youths. My father is distrustful: I am not human, not his human. He scowls at me. Let him scowl: that is as much as he can do. Even as I sense his cynical gaze, I know I am invincible to his illness of idealism, too. And there is my mother, spilling wine on herself. She is also a negative image.

The earth slopes precariously: fragile mass, teetering strength. The open space is
scattered with diffuse water and light, held captive in anti-radiance: infinitely circulated
particles dimmed, cooled, emaciated to the monotony of existence: and now the space is
closed: suffocated by the smoky tonic of life, water and light. The trees sway, disjoint
with their roots; fade into hegemonic darkness. They suffocate too, suffocated by the
smoky tonic of life, water and light. The fumes of life creep over the earth: sustaining
and suffocating, sustaining and suffocating: masochist fumes, masochist earth: cold,
sadistic torturer. I walk through the earth: dark, cool, homogeneous - linear system,
consistent solution: one dimension, the collapsed projection of three dimensions, of
closed space clouded by masochist fumes; dark cement, appropriated matter, the fabric
of the monolith. I clear the surface as I travel: continuous ejection, smooth coldness,
gray trail. Four figures stand on me, frozen - fixed, static, constant, immediate,
immanent. Their bodies do not move; I feel their unmoving weight. They are not
immune to the masochist fumes: to the wading dense mixture of water and light: they
quietly choke, they are held frozen - perception shallow, cognition malfunctional. Their
masses stand like rocks, like the trees - fragile mass, teetering strength. They have been
standing for a long time, standing with the earth, standing on me, while I walk through
the earth, walking with me, on me, standing - suffocating on the dense tonic, fatally
sustaining: water and light - consciousness atrophied, antiagents, wanderers, mindless,
forward, stand. I am their carrier. When they wander to the end of my infinite length, to
the edge of the earth, I will be there to watch them fall off it.

**POV I**. I feel the cool metal of the extractor tunneling protruding from my neck, but only barely: the 
screen is too fixating, too enthralling. A beautiful boy runs across golden fields; he shouts, 
whoops, beams. His hand is extended, reaching, beckoning. “Come,” he says. “Come with me.” 
His words, sacred notes, flow through the wind and out of the sensory-audio amplifier unit, 
directly into the reverberating depths of my ear canals. My heart jumps; I smile too. My neck 
strains; my throat tenses. “Yes,” I say, but it gets lost in a barricade of saliva and comes out as a 
disgusting gargle. I clear my throat quickly, lest he turn away before he hears my response. It is 
not a pretty sound either. “Yes, I’ll come with you!”. I reach forwards, I leap towards him, yes, 
suddenly – now, yes, there is no time to wait.
My movement causes a rush of organic fluid to flow through the extractor tunneling. I feel dizzy. 
Distinct lines and angles transmogrify into blurred amoeba-like forms. The screen suddenly 
freezes, devoid of movement: the boy is in the middle of inviting me to join him, his hand a blur 
of excited movement frozen too soon, a dream in buffering. It remains like this for several 
seconds, an abnormally long period for a refresh. The screen suddenly resumes: all is normal. 
But now he is off in the distance, his back facing towards me. 
I exhale. My neck relaxes. I swallow a heavily viscous accumulation of saliva. I lean back into 
the chair. He’s gone, he’s gone. How disappointing. The screen is now empty: there are only 
golden fields which have lost their shine; the boy has retreated into the pixelated distance. 
The steady pulse of the fluid extraction assemblage becomes more present to me now: rhythmic 
hydraulic compressions – pumping. This is the exchange: I broke it.

**POV II**. Subject is seated. Fluid extraction assemblage is functional. Entertainment medium operational.
Fluid quality: satisfactory. Neurotoxins: absent. Dopamine: moderate. Stable condition.

Seeking approval.
Dialogue approved: rendering audio and visual synchronization... displaying.
Alert: fluid quality highly damaged. Neurotoxins: high. Dopamine: high. Unstable condition. 
Cortisol: rising quickly. Batch will be rendered impotent if current fluid quality state is extended. 
Subject data logging: subject produces gargling noise, unintelligible.
Subject data logging: subject clears throat aggressively.
Subject data logging: subject is producing continued aggressive gargling noise. Potential 
asphyxiation risk caused by accumulated saliva viscosity.
Alert: fluid quality highly damaged. Neurotoxins: high. Dopamine: high. Unstable condition. 
Cortisol: high. Batch will be rendered impotent if current fluid quality state is extended. 
Subject data logging: subject is resisting restraints.
Recommend: reorient neurostimulator entertainment medium content to: peaceful prairie. 
Recommendation strength: very high.
Neurostimulator entertainment medium content change: approved. Rendering... displaying.
Fluid quality: satisfactory. Neurotoxins: absent. Dopamine: moderate. Stable condition. Future 
fluid quality forecast: positive, sustainable.
Administrator 3 message logging: That was a close call. We need to keep a better eye on 
approved auditory and anthropomorphic stimulation for this subject.
Administrator 2 message logging: Yes. But we are lucky that we pulled it back in time.
Administrator 3 message logging: Indeed. We all know that we have had to take more extreme 
measures for previous subjects. Let’s not forget this and move to the next room.
Session logging: Supervised administration terminated; unsupervised extraction regime
