## Week 6 Thursday
- Summary, changing time - going between different temporalities
- How to dilate and speed time to change perception and narrative structure?
- Is summary an event?
- Energy - tension and pace. What is the excitement, what is the spark? What propoels the reader forward? It is the result of textures, tensions, story paces.
- Energy is the result of craft choices.
- Energy changes the temporality of the writing.
- Enery is not fixed - it's a spectrum. 
- Knowing when to be low energy is as important as being high energy.
- Sometimes cold, low energy scenes can generate tremendous tension, perhaps the highest tension, irreducible tension.
- Principles of increased Energy: subject choice, sparky word choice, super-specifics, gaps and leaps
- How to lower energy?
- How to critically fulfill or subvert expectations?
- Gap - leaping from one thing to anohter.
- Format leaps - interrupts an expectation of consistency. 
- Dialogue leaps - what are they saying without saying?
- Symbolic leap - connections between imagery, action, dialogue
- Object leaps - disjunctures which force readers to bridge bizarre objects. 
- Relationship between the author and the reader: how much work does the reader have to do? How does the author guide the reader?
