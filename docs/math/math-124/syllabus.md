## Grades

> My teaching philosophy is that students should not be withheld from opportunities to improve. Courses should be created to give all students the opportunity for growth. Thus, if you struggle with a topic, you should be given the chance to improve and demonstrate growth. This philosophy is reflected in the course's organization.

- For a passing grade (2.0):
  - Submit all preclass reflections;
  - Obtain at least 60% in every quiz;
  - Obtain 60%+ on 2/3 exams;
  - Obtain 60%+ on every homework assignment.
- Median GPA will be within 0.2 points of 2.9
- GPA increase of 0.1 (max 0.2 increase) allowed for those that
  - Pass the class and perform all learning assignments
  - Pass the class and submit 80% of all in-class assignments
  - **To obtain a 4.0** requires both of these to be fulfilled (maximum GPA without GPA increase is 3.8)

*Grading scale/system for correctness*

| Points | Quality |
| --- | --- |
| 10 | Correct |
| 9 | Near correct |
| 5 | Right ideas, significant errors |
| 1 | Genuine but false approach |
| 0 | No meaningful attempt |

*Class weighting*

| Course Component | Weight |
| --- | --- |
| Worksheets | 4% |
| Quizzes (6) | 6% each |
| Midterms (2) | 15% each |
| Final | 15% |
| Homework | 15% |
