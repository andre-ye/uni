## Week 1 Wednesday -- Introduction to Groups

A group $$(G, *)$$ is a pair with a set $$G$$ and an operation $$*: G \times G \to G$$ which is associative, has an identity, and has inverses.
A group is abelian if the operation is commutative.

The order of a group is its cardinality

Examples of groups:
- The reals with addition, $$(\mathbb{R}, +)$$
- Nonzero field with multiplication, $$(F - \{0\}, \times)$$
- Symmetric group on $$n$$ symbols, $$S_n$$: $$S_n = \{ f \{ 1, ..., n\} \to \{ 1, ..., n \} \} $$ with $$f$$ bijective

---

## Week 2 Monday -- Subgroups
- Last time:
  - A group has a unique identity element and every element has a unique inverse
  - Order of an element: minimum integer power to equal the identity
  - If $$g^l = g^m$$ for $$m \neq l$$, $$\vert g \vert$$ finite and $$l \equiv_{\vert g \vert} m$$
- The dihedral group $$D_n$$ is generated by
  - $$r$$, the rotation clockwise
  - $$s$$, symmetry along the $$x$$-axis
- Generated, meaning: every element in $$D_n$$ can be written as a product of $$r$$ and $$s$$
- In $$D_n$$, $$r^n = e$$ and $$s^2 = e$$, also $$srs = r^{-1}$$
- Any element in $$D_n$$ can be written as $$r^a s^b$$ for $$0 \leq a \leq n-1$$ and $$b \in \{0, 1\}$$
- Simplify $$s r^2 s = sr e r s = srs srs = r^{-1} r^{-1} = r^{-2}$$. Generalizing for all $$a$$, $$s r^a s = r^{-a}$$
- A subgroup of $$G$$ is a subset $$H \subseteq G$$ such that $$H$$ is a group under the same operation as $$G$$
- To check if a subset $$k$$ is a subgroup of $$G$$, check
  - $$k$$ is nonempty
  - $$k$$ has the identity
  - $$k$$ is closed under the operation
  - $$k$$ is closed under inverses
- You can always construct the trivial subgroup (identity or the group itself)
- Or, $$\forall g \in G$$, the cyclic group generated by $$g$$ is the subgroup of powers of $$g$$.
- Observation: $$\vert \langle g \rangle \vert = \vert g \vert$$
- $$\langle g \rangle$$ is abelian

---

## Week 2 Wednesday -- Subgroups and Homomorphisms
- $$D_n = \{ r^a s^b, 0 \le a \le n - 1, 0 \le b \le 1 \}$$ with $$r^n = 1$$, $$s^2 = 1$$, $$srs = r^{-1}$$
- Cyclic subgroup of $$G$$: generated by $$\langle g \rangle = \{ g^k \vert k \in \mathbb{Z} \}$$
- The order of $$g$$ is the order of $$\langle g \rangle$$
- A group is a cyclic group if $$\exists g \in G$$ such that $$\langle g \rangle = G$$
- $$\mathbb{Z}_n$$ is a cyclic group under addition
- Any subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic
  1. Take a generator, look at all the multiples, let $$m_0$$ be the minimum such that $$g^{m_0}$$ belongs to the subgroup $$H$$
  2. Want to show that $$\langle g^{m_0} \rangle = H$$
  3. It is clear that $$\langle g^{m_0} \rangle \subseteq H$$
  4. Argue by contradiction that $$\exists h \in H \setminus \langle g^{m_0} \rangle$$. This does not hold. So it must be that $$H \subseteq \langle g^{m_0} \rangle$$. Show this with $$h = g^a = g^{k m_0 + r}$$ with $$0 \le r < h_0$$, and show that we can find a smaller element in $$H$$.
- Given a group $$G$$, $$Z(G)$$ is the center of $$G$$, the set of elements in $$G$$ which commute with everything else
- Given two groups $$(G, *_G)$$ and $$(H, *_H)$$, a homomorphism $$\phi: G \to H$$ is a function such that $$\phi(a *_G b) = \phi(a) *_H \phi(b)$$
  - A homomorphism commutes with the group operation
  - e.g. $$G = (\mathbb{R}^+, \times)$$, $$H = (\mathbb{R}, +)$$, $$\phi(x) = \log x$$
- Let $$f : G \to H$$ be a group homomorphism.
  1. $$f(G) = \text{Im}(f)$$ is a subgroup of $$H$$
  2. $$f^{-1} (1_H) = \{ g \in G \vert f(g) = 1_H \}$$ is a subgroup of $$G$$ -- the preimage of the identity is a subgroup in $$G$$
  3. The identity is preserved: $$f(1_G) = 1_H$$
  4. Inverses are preserved: $$f(g^{-1}) = f(g)^{-1}$$

---

## Week 2 Friday -- Homomorphisms and Isomorphisms

If $$\text{Im}(f) \subseteq H$$, then we need that
1. $$1_H \in \text{Im}(f)$$ (the identity is in the image)
2. If $$h_1, h_2 \in \text{Im}(f)$$, then $$h_1 *_H h_2 \in \text{Im}(f)$$ (closed under the operation)
3. If $$h \in \text{Im}(f)$$, then $$h^{-1} \in \text{Im}(f)$$ (closed under inverses)

A homomorphism is an isomorphism if $$f$$ is injective and surjective.
- Cyclic groups are isomorphic to $$\mathbb{Z}$$ or $$\mathbb{Z}_n$$
- If $$G$$ is a cyclic group, there is a surjective homomorphism from $$\mathbb{Z}$$ to $$G$$, namely $$\phi: \mathbb{Z} \to G$$ with $$\phi(k) = g^k$$

Cayley's Theorem:
If $$G$$ is a group, then $$G$$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of $$A(G)$$, where $$A(G)$$ is the group of bijections from $$G$$ to $$G$$ under composition.

Strategy:
We will produce an injective homomorphism $$\phi: G \to A(G)$$ such that $$\phi(G)$$ is a subgroup of $$A(G)$$.
We will define $$\phi(g)$$ such that $$\phi(g)(h) = gh$$.
Every function defined by $$g$$ is basically multiplication by $$g$$ on the left.
Some things to check:
- The definition of $$\phi(g)$$ ensures it is injective
<!-- - $$\phi(g)$$ is a bijection -->
- Show that $$\phi$$ is a homomorphism

---

## Week 3 Wednesday -- ??
- Isomorphism -- "same look"
- Automorphism -- "self look"
- If $$f : G \to H$$ is an isomorphism, there exists an inverse map $$f^{-1} : H \to G$$ such that $$f^{-1}$$ is also an isomorphism
- If $$f : G \to H$$ is an injective homomorphism, then $$G \cong \text{Im}(f)$$.

## Week 4 Monday -- Congruence Classes

Recap
- Every $$\sigma \in S_n$$ can be written as a product of transpositions and of disjoint cycles. 
- Disjoint cycles commute

Definition:
Given $$G$$ and a subgroup $$H$$, $$g_1 \equiv_H g_2$$ if $$g_1 g_2^{-1} \in H$$.

- Congruence is an equivalence relation -- commutative, transitive
- Define $$Hg$$ to be the group of all elements in $$G$$ which are congruent to $$g$$, mod $$H$$
- If $$H g_1 \cap H g_2 \neq \emptyset$$, then $$H g_1 = H g_2$$. Proof:
  1. Let $$k \in H g_1 \cap H g_2$$
  2. Let $$k \in H g_1$$. Then $$k g_1^{-1} \in H$$.
  3. Let $$k \in H g_2$$. Then $$k g_2^{-1} \in H$$.
  4. $$x \equiv g_1$$ and $$g_1 \equiv k$$, meaning $$x \equiv k$$
  5. $$k \equiv g_2$$, so $$x \equiv g_2$$.
  6. So $$x \equiv g_1 \equiv g_2$$
- Assume $$G$$ finite and $$H$$ subgroup. If $$g \in G$$, $$\vert H e \vert = \vert H g \vert$$. All the cosets have the same size.
- Lagrange's theorem: If $$G$$ is finite and $$H$$ is a subgroup, then $$\vert G \vert = \vert H \vert \cdot \vert H g \vert$$.


---

## Week 4 Wednesday -- Normal Subgroups

Proposition.
If $$G$$ is a group and $$H$$ is its subgroup, with $$g \in G$$, then $$\vert H 1 \vert = \vert H g \vert = \{ g' \in G : g' \equiv_H g \}$$.

We will construct the function $$f : H1 \to Hg$$ which is a bijection.
We take an element $$g \in G$$ and $$h \in H$$, and map $$g$$ to $$hg$$.

Lagrange's theorem
- All the cosets are disjoint and have the same number of elements
- Subsets cover all of $$G$$ and these subsets never intersect
- We have that $$\vert G \vert = \sum \vert Hg \vert = \sum \vert H \cdot 1 \vert = \vert H g \vert \vert H \vert$$

Normal subgroups
- You can't add congruence classes in nonabelian groups in the same way you can for abelian groups
- A subgroup $$H$$ of $$G$$ is normal if $$\forall g \in G$$, $$g H g^{-1} = H$$

---

## Week 4 Friday -- More Normal Subgroups

- Not all groups are normal, e.g. $$D_3$$ or $$\langle (1, 2) \rangle \subseteq S_3$$
- Criteria is that $$g H g^{-1} = H$$, which is to say that $$g H = H g$$
- $$a \equiv_H b$$ and $$c \equiv_H d$$ implies that $$ac \equiv_H bd$$
- Let $$G$$ be a group and $$H$$ its subgroup. Then
  1. The congruence classes modulo $$H$$ form a group $$G / H$$
  2. There is a surjective homomorphism from $$G \to G / H$$, where each element $$g \in G$$ is mapped to its congruence class.
- We will define $$H g_1 \cdot H g_2 = H g_1 g_2$$

---

## Week 6 Monday -- Isomorphism Theorem for Groups
- Let $$f : G \to H$$ be a group homomorphism. Then the kernel of $$f$$ is a normal subgroup of $$G$$
- There exists a function $$\bar{f} : G / \text{ker}(f) \to H$$ such that $$\bar{f}(\pi(g)) = f(g)$$, where $$\pi : G \to G / \text{ker}(f)$$ is the natural projection from an element in $$G$$ to its congruence class
- Consider the map from $$D_6$$ to $$\mathbb{Z}_2$$ givn by $$f(r^a s^b) = b$$.
  - The kernel of $$f$$ is $$\langle r \rangle$$
  - The two congruence classes are $$\langle r \rangle$$ and $$\langle r \rangle s$$
  - The map $$\bar{f}$$ is given by $$\bar{f}(\langle r \rangle) = 0$$ and $$\bar{f}(\langle r \rangle s) = 1$$
- Another example: map from $$GL_2(\mathbb{R}) \to \mathbb{C}^*$$ which sends a matrix to its determinant
  - The kernel of this map is the set of all matrices with determinant 1 (the special linear group, $$SL_2(\mathbb{R})$$)
  - $$G / \text{ker}(f)$$ is the set of congruence classes of matrices modulo the special linear group
- Theorem. For $$f : G \to H$$ homomorphism, there exists an injective homomorphism $$\bar{f} : G / \text{ker}(f) \to H$$ such that $$f = \bar{f} \circ \pi$$, where $$\pi : G \to G / \text{ker}(f)$$ is the natural projection
  - Rephrased: for a homomorphism of groups $$f :  G \to H$$, $$G / \text{ker}(f) \cong \text{Im}(f)$$
- Proof of the theorem
  1. Define the function $$\bar{f}$$ : $$\bar{f}(\text{ker}(f) g) = f(g)$$
  2. Need to check that this function is well-defined. If $$\text{ker}(f) g = \text{ker}(f) g'$$, then $$f(g) = f(g')$$
  3. We need to verify that $$\bar{f}$$ is a homomorphism
  4. We need to check that $$\bar{f}$$ is injective: namely, check that $$\ker(\bar{f}) = \{ 1 \}$$
- If $$f$$ is surjective, then $$\bar{f}$$ is an isomorphism between the quotient group and $$H$$
  - Note that $$GL_n / SL_n \cong \mathbb{R} \setminus \{ 0 \}$$

---

## Week 6 Wednesday -- Iso Thm pt 2
- Example: Consider $$G = \mathbb{C}$$ and $$H = \{ z \in \mathbb{C}* : \vert z \vert = 1 \}
- If you work it out, $$H$$ is closed under multiplication.
- Turns out that $$(\mathbb{R}^+, *) \cong \mathbb{C}^* / H$$
- To show that a group is isomorphic to a quotient group $$G / H$$, you need to find a surjective homomorphism $$f : G \to H$$ and then show that $$\text{ker}(f) = H$$
- In general: dividing an infinite field by the set of elements with constant norm (say unit norm) gives you $$\mathbb{R}^+$$?
- Suppose $$f : G \to H$$ is a surjective homomorphism, that $$K$$ is a normal subgroup of $$G$$ and contained in the kernel of $$f$$. Then the map from $$G / K \to H$$ is injective iff $$K = \text{ker}(f)$$

---

## Week 6 Friday -- Iso Thm pt 3
- To prove isomorphisms, show the presence of a homomorphism with a kernel equal to (or contains) the subgroup you want to quotient by, then you know that the quotient group is isomorphic to the image of the homomorphism
- For instance, $$\mathbb{C}^* / \{ 1, -1 \} \cong \mathbb{C}^*$$ using the map $$f(z) = z^2$$
- Proposition: there is a bijection between the subgroups of $$G / K$$ and the subgroups of $$G$$ containing $$K$$.
  - The map from subgroups of $$G / K$$ to the subgroups of $$G$$ containing $$K$$: preimage of the subgroup under the natural projection
  - The map from subgroups of $$G$$ containing $$K$$ to the subgroups of $$G / K$$: the image of the subgroup under the natural projection
  - This bijection sends normal subgroups to normal subgroups

---

## Week 7 Monday -- Third Isomorphism Theorem
- Two useful definitions of normal subgroups
  - For all $$ g\in G$$, $$g N g^{-1} \subseteq N$$
  - For all $$g \in G$$, for all $$n \in N$$, exists $$n' \in N$$ such that $$gn = n' g$$
- Composition of homomorphisms is a homomorphism; you can quotient groups repeatedly
- Kernels are normal subgroups. Normal subgroups are the kernels of some homomorphisms
- From the quotient process $$G \to G / N \to (G / N) / K$$, you know that the kernel $$\pi^{-1}(K)$$ is a normal subgroup of $$G$$ containing $$N$$
- Restatement of the first isomorphism theorem
  1. If $$k \subseteq \text{ker}(f)$$ with $$k$$ a normal subgroup of $$G$$, $$f$$ induces $$\bar{f} : G / K \to H$$
  2. If $$k = \text{ker}(f)$$, $$\bar{f}$$ is injective
  3. $$f$$ surjective iff $$\bar{f}$$ surjective
- Third isomorphism theorem: if $$K \lefttriangleeq G / N$$, $$(G / N) / K \cong G / \pi^{-1}(K)$$ for $$\pi : G \to G / N$$
  - Theorem used if you have a quotient and you want to understand what it is
  - e.g. $$K = \{0, 3, 6, 9 \} \subseteq \mathbb{Z}_{12}$$, $$\mathbb{Z}_{12} / K = (\mathbb{Z} / 12\mathbb{Z}) / K = \mathbb{Z} / \pi^{-1}(K) = \mathbb{Z} / 3\mathbb{Z}$$, where $$\pi : \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}_{12}$$
- Can you find a subgroup $$H$$ of $$GL_2$$ such that $$SL_2 \subseteq H$$ and $$H$$ not normal? Impossible, because there is a bijection from subgroups of $$G / N$$ and the subgroups of $$G$$ containing $$N$$
  - Moreover, there is a bijection between normal subgroups of $$G / N$$ and normal subgroups of $$G$$ containing $$N$$
  - "Out of the subgroups of $$G$$ containing $$N$$, which ones are normal?" becomes "Out of the subgroups of $$G / N$$, which ones are normal?" Because $$GL_2 / SL_2 \cong \mathbb{R}^*$$, it is abelian, and therefore every subgroup is normal. This means that every subgroup of $$GL_2$$ containing $$SL_2$$ is normal.
- A group is simple if every normal subgroup is either the identity or the group itself, which means that if you try to quotient by a normal subgroup, you get either the identity or the group itself
- You can decrease complexity by quotienting by normal subgroups
- $$A_4$$ is simple if $$n \neq 4$$.

---

## Week 7 Wednesday -- 
Review
- The set of all subgroups in $$G / N$$ is isomorphic to the set of all subgroups in $$G$$ containing $$N$$
- The set of all *normal* subgroups in $$G / N$$ is isomorphic to the set of all normal subgroups in $$G$$ containing $$N$$
- Then $$K \lefttriangleeq G / N$$, $$(G / N) / K \cong G / \pi^{-1}(K)$$, where $$\pi : G \to G / N$$
- Not true in general: if $$f$$ homomorphism $$G \to H$$, $$N \lefttriangleeq G$$, $$f(N) \subseteq H$$ is not necessarily normal
- If $$f$$ is surjective, then $$f(N)$$ is normal

Suppose you have a group $$G$$, with $$N_1, N_2, \hdots, N_m \lefttriangleeq G$$, satisfying the following properties:
- For any $$1 \le i \le m$$, $$N_i \cap N_1 N_2 \hdots N_{i-1} N_{i+1} \hdots N_m = \{ e \}$$, where the product is just generation of elements from sets
- For all $$g \in G$$, there exists $$n_1, n_2, \hdots, n_m$$ such that $$g = n_1 \cdot n_2 \cdot \hdots \cdot n_m$$, where $$n_i \in N_i$$
Then $$G \cong N_1 \times N_2 \times \hdots \times N_m$$.
Basically: if you have a bunch of "disjoint" normal subgroups and they generate $$G$$, then $$G$$ just is their Cartesian product.

Proof for $$2$$ subgroups case.
1. We know that $$N_1, N_2 \lefttriangleeq G$$, $$N_1 \cap N_2 = \{ e \}$$, and $$N_1 N_2 = G$$ We want to prove that $$N_1 \times N_2 \cong G$$.
2. Consider the function $$f : N_1 \times N_2 \to G$$ given by $$f(n_1, n_2) = n_1 n_2$$. This is a surjective function, for free.
3. It is a homomorphism: $$f((n_1, n_2) \cdot (n_1', n_2')) = f(n_1 n_1', n_2 n_2') = n_1 n_1' n_2 n_2' = f(n_1, n_2) f(n_1', n_2')$$. This relies on showing that elements in $$N_1, N_2$$ commute. bitches aint shit frfr ong no cap
4. Injectivity: need to show that the kernel of $$f$$ is one. You can use the fact that the intersection is $$e$$ to show that the kernel is $$e$$.

Theorem.
$$G$$ is a finite abelian group.
$$G \cong \mathbb{Z}_{p_1^{k_1}} \times \hdots \times \mathbb{Z}_{p_m^{k_m}}$$, where $$p_i$$ are primes.
