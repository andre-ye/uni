## Week 1 Wednesday -- Introduction to Groups

A group $$(G, *)$$ is a pair with a set $$G$$ and an operation $$*: G \times G \to G$$ which is associative, has an identity, and has inverses.
A group is abelian if the operation is commutative.

The order of a group is its cardinality

Examples of groups:
- The reals with addition, $$(\mathbb{R}, +)$$
- Nonzero field with multiplication, $$(F - \{0\}, \times)$$
- Symmetric group on $$n$$ symbols, $$S_n$$: $$S_n = \{ f \{ 1, ..., n\} \to \{ 1, ..., n \} \} $$ with $$f$$ bijective

## Week 2 Monday -- 
- Last time:
  - A group has a unique identity element and every element has a unique inverse
  - Order of an element: minimum integer power to equal the identity
  - If $$g^l = g^m$$ for $$m \neq l$$, $$\vert g \vert$$ finite and $$l \equiv_{\vert g \vert} m$$
- The dihedral group $$D_n$$ is generated by
  - $$r$$, the rotation clockwise
  - $$s$$, symmetry along the $$x$$-axis
- Generated, meaning: every element in $$D_n$$ can be written as a product of $$r$$ and $$s$$
- In $$D_n$$, $$r^n = e$$ and $$s^2 = e$$, also $$srs = r^{-1}$$
- Any element in $$D_n$$ can be written as $$r^a s^b$$ for $$0 \leq a \leq n-1$$ and $$b \in \{0, 1\}$$
- Simplify $$s r^2 s = sr e r s = srs srs = r^{-1} r^{-1} = r^{-2}$$. Generalizing for all $$a$$, $$s r^a s = r^{-a}$$
- A subgroup of $$G$$ is a subset $$H \subseteq G$$ such that $$H$$ is a group under the same operation as $$G$$
- To check if a subset $$k$$ is a subgroup of $$G$$, check
  - $$k$$ is nonempty
  - $$k$$ has the identity
  - $$k$$ is closed under the operation
  - $$k$$ is closed under inverses
- You can always construct the trivial subgroup (identity or the group itself)
- Or, $$\forall g \in G$$, the cyclic group generated by $$g$$ is the subgroup of powers of $$g$$.
- Observation: $$\vert \langle g \rangle \vert = \vert g \vert$$
- $$\langle g \rangle$$ is abelian
