## Week 1 Wednesday -- 

A group $$(G, *)$$ is a pair with a set $$G$$ and an operation $$*: G \times G \to G$$ which is associative, has an identity, and has inverses.
A group is abelian if the operation is commutative.

The order of a group is its cardinality

Examples of groups:
- The reals with addition, $$(\mathbb{R}, +)$$
- Nonzero field with multiplication, $$(F - \{0\}, \times)$$
- Symmetric group on $$n$$ symbols, $$S_n$$: $$S_n = \{ f \{ 1, ..., n\} \to \{ 1, ..., n \} \} $$ with $$f$$ bijective
