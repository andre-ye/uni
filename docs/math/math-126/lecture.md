## Week 1 Monday - Syllabus and Course Introduction
- Canvas holds all the information in the course.
- Preferrred way of communicating - Ed
- In-class work counts 3% of the total grades. If you submit 80% of in-class, you will get full credit for that category.
- Quizzes are demonstrations of conceptual understandings with relatively simple questions. Taken during Thursday quiz sections.
  - You must pass every quiz.
  - You can retake quizzes up to 3 times.
- Homework
  - 10% of the homework will be dropped. Indirectly raises the homework grade.
  - You can request extensions with no penalty for every assignment. However, it needs to be done 17 days within the original due date. Two weeks and three days = 17 days to complete the homework.
- Midterms
  - APril 21st, May 19th
  - Need to take both midterms
- Final exam
  - Common final exam - 5:00 to 7:50 PM on Saturday in Guggenheim
- Worksheets - there are no official worksheets in Math 126.
  - There are worksheets available from Dr. Loveless that we will work on during quiz section.
- Grades
  - 2.0: submit all preclass reflections and have an average of at least 70%. You must pass every quiz.
- Median will be set to 2.9. 50% or less will be a 0.


Course Content
- 126 in the beginning is reiminiscent of 124.
- We will expand many of the tools in 126 in three-dimensions.
- Derivatives and integration in higher-dimension functions.
- For two weeks, we will talk about Taylor polynomials and Taylor series.

Coordinate Systems and Vectors
- All axes must be perpendicular. We will determine a $$z$$ axis perpendicular to an $$x$$ and $$y$$.
- By convention, there is no freedom. Right hand rule - start with fingers in the $$x$$ and move towards the $$y$$-axis. The thumb points in the $$z$$ axis.
- The origin is the point at which the three axes intersect.
- You can decide to put to the origin anywhere in the space you please. You make a decision and live with that - all equations are in reference to the origin.
- In three dimensions, we have eight segments/sectors - *octants* (as opposed to quadrants in two dimensions).
- We want to use the coordinate system to describe a variety of geometric entities.
- Points - we can describe any point in the coordinate system using $$(a, b, c)$$. We always write in the $$(x, y, z)$$ order.
- Vector - a quantity with a direction and a magnitude.
  - Often represented as arrows.
  - Vectors with the same direction and magnitude are the same, regardless of their position in space.
  - A vector is only something that is applied.
- To indicate, you can use $$\vec{u}$$ or a bolded $$u$$.
  - $$\vec{u} = \langle 2, 4 \rangle$$

## Week 1 Wednesday
- Think about sets as bags upon which to put stuff in.
- Give the form of the elements put in, followed by a vertical line ('such that', 'which hold') and a rule. 
- The dot product is a scalar.
- The dot product and the Pythagorean theorem are both good tests for orthogonality.
