## Chapter 12: Vectors and the Geometry of Space

### 12.1: Three-Dimensional Coordinate Systems
- Three axes form a three-dimensional space.
- The three-dimensional space is divided into octants.
- If we drop from $$P$$ to some plane, it is the projection of $$P$$ onto the $$xy$$-plane.
- The Cartesian product $$\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} = {(x, y, z) \| x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}}$$ is the set of all ordered triples of real numbers; denoted $$\mathbb{R}^3$$.

#### Surfaces
{: .no_toc }

- If $$k$$ is constant, then:
  - $$x = k$$ represents a plane parallel to the $$yz$$-plane
  - $$y = k$$ represents a plane parallel to the $$xz$$-plane
  - $$z = k$$ represents a plane parallel to the $$xy$$-plane
- Circles and cylinders, free restirction over axes

#### Distance and Spheres
{: .no_toc }

The distance formula $$\|P_1P_2\|$$ between two points $$P_1 (x_1, y_1, z_1)$$ and $$P_2 (x_2, y_2, z_2)$$ is

$$\|P_1P_2\| = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}$$

- This formula is a natural extension of the Pythagorean theorem in two dimensions.
- The equation of a sphere with center $$C$ (h, k, l)$$ and radius $$r$$ is

$$(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 + (z - l)^2 = r^2$$
