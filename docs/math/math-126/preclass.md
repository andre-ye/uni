## Week 1 Monday (12.1)
- Three-dimensional spaces
- We need an origin - a reference point. Begin with two axes that are perpendicular. The third axis must extend perpendicular to both of the existing axes.
- Right hand rule: helps you determine in which direction a third axis points.
- We can describe every point space with some set of coordinates $$(a, b, c)$$/$$(x, y, z)$$.

- $$\mathbb{R} = (-\infty, \infty)$$ - the set of real unmbers.
- Set notation. All points in 3D form:

$$\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} = \mathbb{R}^3$$

$$ = {(x, y, z) | x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}$$

- Set theory: {\text{bag of possibilities} | \text{ rule(s)}}$$
- Surfaces: $${(x, y, z) | x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}, z = 3}$$ gives you the $$x-y$$ plane hovering at level $$z = 3$$.
- Three important planes: at $$x = 0, y = 0, z = 0$$.
- Just stating the rule $$z = 3$$ (the equations) is also acceptable.

## Week 1 Wednesday (12.2)
- Vector: depicted as an arrow, with a length as its magnitude, an initial point, and a terminal point
- Adding two vectors. The sum of two vectors is the vector from the initial point of one vector to the terminal point of the other vector.
- Scalar multiplication. Scalar - a real number. Preserves parallel properties.
- A position vector is a vector extending from the origin to a specific point.
- Components - number of dimensions of a vector.
- Length/magnitude of a vector can be calculated using Pythagorean theorem
- Standard basis vectors - unit vectors along the dimensions.
  - You can decompose any vector into a linear sum of the standard basis vectors.
