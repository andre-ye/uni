## Week 1 Wednesday: A Fancier Version of Long Division
- Division Algorithm / Theorem: given integers $$a, b$$, with $$b > 0$$, there exist unique integers $$q, r$$ such that $$a = bq + r$$ and $$0 \leq r < b$$
- Rings where the division theorem holds -- Euclidean rings
- $$\mathbb{Z}$$ is a Euclidean ring

Non-constructive Existence Proof
1. Consider the set $$S$$ which is all things you can write in the form $$a - bx$$, where $$x \in \mathbb{Z}$$ and $$a - bx \ge 0$$
2. $$S$$ is a non-empty set of non-negative integers
3. Use the well-ordering principle (every non-empty set of non-negative integers has a least element) to conclude that $$S$$ has a least element, call it $$r$$
4. $$r$$ by definition is non-negative.
5. Show $$r < b$$
6. Uniqueness (show by contradiction)

- You can have sets of real numbers which do not follow the well-ordering principle

## Week 1 Friday: Division ($$\S$$ 1.2)
- Three equivalent conditions of the GCD of $$a,b$$
  - Greatest in the usual ordering of $$a$$ and $$b$$
  - Maximal (by divisibility) divisor of $$a, b$$
  - integral linear combination of $$a, b$$ (Theorem 1.2) -- it is the smallest positive integral linear combination
    - Any integral combination is not necessarily the GCD; if you know it is the smallest positive one, then you know it is the GCD
- A divisor: the numerator is the central player rather than the denominator
- 0 is not a divisor of anything / you can't divide by 0
- $$GCD(a, b)$$ is often written as $$(a, b)$$
- Ideals are represents in parentheses and GCDs are the ideal generated by $$a$$ and $$b$$
