## Week 1 Wednesday: A Fancier Version of Long Division
- Division Algorithm / Theorem: given integers $$a, b$$, with $$b > 0$$, there exist unique integers $$q, r$$ such that $$a = bq + r$$ and $$0 \leq r < b$$
- Rings where the division theorem holds -- Euclidean rings
- $$\mathbb{Z}$$ is a Euclidean ring

Non-constructive Existence Proof
1. Consider the set $$S$$ which is all things you can write in the form $$a - bx$$, where $$x \in \mathbb{Z}$$ and $$a - bx \ge 0$$
2. $$S$$ is a non-empty set of non-negative integers
3. Use the well-ordering principle (every non-empty set of non-negative integers has a least element) to conclude that $$S$$ has a least element, call it $$r$$
4. $$r$$ by definition is non-negative.
5. Show $$r < b$$
6. Uniqueness (show by contradiction)

- You can have sets of real numbers which do not follow the well-ordering principle

## Week 1 Friday: Division ($$\S$$ 1.2)
- Three equivalent conditions of the GCD of $$a,b$$
  - Greatest in the usual ordering of $$a$$ and $$b$$
  - Maximal (by divisibility) divisor of $$a, b$$
  - integral linear combination of $$a, b$$ (Theorem 1.2) -- it is the smallest positive integral linear combination
    - Any integral combination is not necessarily the GCD; if you know it is the smallest positive one, then you know it is the GCD
- A divisor: the numerator is the central player rather than the denominator
- 0 is not a divisor of anything / you can't divide by 0
- $$GCD(a, b)$$ is often written as $$(a, b)$$
- Ideals are represents in parentheses and GCDs are the ideal generated by $$a$$ and $$b$$

## Week 2 Monday: Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
- Main landmark theorem of arithmetic: Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (unique factorization): every nonzero integer is either a unit or can be written as a product of primes of prime integers uniquely
  - Uniquely: up to reordering and plus/minus
- A unit (in the integers): something such that there exists some other integer where their product is 1. In the integers, these are $$\pm 1$$
- The set of integers you can get from the multiples of $$n$$ are the same as $$-n$$; they behave very similarly in general.
- You cannot tell the difference between $$n$$ and $$-n$$ with divisibility relationships
- **Theorem 1.5.** Let $$n$$ be a nonzero integer which is not a unit. Then $$n$$ is prime iff (if $$n \nmid b$$ and $$n \nmid c$$, then $$n \nmid bc$$).
  - The only divisors of $$n$$ are the units and itself. (weaker)
  - The modern algebra definition is more general / stronger.
  - Rewrite as $$n \vert bc \implies n \vert b \text{ or } n \vert c$$
- In 2.1: congruence classes are sets (infinite subsets of the numbers)

## Weed 2 Wednesday: Congruence Classes
- Given some integer $$a$$, the congruence class $$\[a\]$$ is the set of all integers congruent to $$a$$ modulo $$n$$
- Given $$a, c \in \mathbb{Z}$$, TFAE

$$ c \in \[ a\]$$
$$c \equiv_n a$$
$$n \vert a-c$$
$$\[ a\] = \[ c\]$$
$$a, c \text{ have the same remainder when divided by } n$$
$$a \in \[ c\]$$
$$\[ a\] \cap \[ c\] \neq \emptyset$$

- Corollary 2.4: no. 4 and no. 7 are equivalent
- Equivalence classes form a partition of any set.
- Congruence is an equivalence class.
- Given any $$a \in \mathbb{Z}, \exists 0 \le r < n$$ s.t. $$\[a\] = \[r\]$$
- Theorem 2: you can substitute with representatives. If $$a \equiv_n b$$ and $$c \equiv_n d$$, then $$a + c \equiv_n b + d$$
- If you want to do addition or multiplication, you can do whatever representative you want in your class.
