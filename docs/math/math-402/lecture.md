## Lecture 1: A Fancier Version of Long Division
- Division Algorithm / Theorem: given integers $$a, b$$, with $$b > 0$$, there exist unique integers $$q, r$$ such that $$a = bq + r$$ and $$0 \leq r < b$$
- Rings where the division theorem holds -- Euclidean rings
- $$\mathbb{Z}$$ is a Euclidean ring

Non-constructive Existence Proof
1. Consider the set $$S$$ which is all things you can write in the form $$a - bx$$, where $$x \in \mathbb{Z}$$ and $$a - bx \ge 0$$
2. $$S$$ is a non-empty set of non-negative integers
3. Use the well-ordering principle (every non-empty set of non-negative integers has a least element) to conclude that $$S$$ has a least element, call it $$r$$
4. $$r$$ by definition is non-negative.
5. Show $$r < b$$
6. Uniqueness (show by contradiction)

- You can have sets of real numbers which do not follow the well-ordering principle
