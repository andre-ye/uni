## What is World Building?

### Introduction from _Building Imaginary Worlds_, Wolf

- Media Studies largely overlooks imaginary worlds.
- Imaginary worlds can be massive
- How to experience an imaginary world?
- Traditional storytelling privileges the linearity of narrative. World building, on the other hand, involves an abundance of 'details' which fall off the narrative but help form experience. 
- Imaginary worlds are organized by other forms of structures.

World-building as a Human Activity
- Imaginary worlds are enjoyed by those who build them.
- Compressed time and space
- Perhaps the building of imaginary worlds is innate or serves evolution.
  - Simulation of simulations: imagination without action
  - All cultures create fictional worlds: intrinsically interesting
  - Engage emotion, disengage action
  -  We can decouple fictional worlds from real experiences.
- World-building can begin very early
- Media Studies is the best basis for understanding imaginary worlds. 

Towards a theory of Imaginary Worlds
- "Subcreation" -- a specific form of creation, reliant; 'sub'
- What is the ontological status of fictional worlds? 
- Most analytical approaches focus on form or narrative of content. But what about the world itself as a form of cstudy?
- Supersystem: network of intertextuality which cuts across different modes of image production and appeals to many different groups.

### Introduction from _Extreme Fabulations_, Shaviro
- Kant -- the conditions of possibility.
- Science fiction writing offers a unique way of understanding problems which are intractable.
- Science fiction extrapolates and imagines
- Science fiction performs the movement of _fabulation_.
  - Takes up vagary and indeterminacy.
  - Respects ontological indeterminacy
- Levi-Strauss: myths as synchronic structures, simulaneously existent.
- Narratives are historical; science fictional fabulation is in futurity; counterfactual.
- Henri Bergson: counterfeit of experience / systematically false experience. Thwarts judgement and reason. **Helps us in conditions of excessive certainty.**
- We cannot interpret science fiction through the cold distance of allegory: we need to accept factual contingent and arbitrarily given conditions.
  - Is this materialist? Or is this idealist?
  - Is this training for the acceptance of given myth?
- Hyperserial format
- IMaginary worlds always already prompt convergence culture: stories spill from one media window to another.
- What makes a film into a cult artifact? Eco: completely furnished, encyclopedia.
- The reader must engage with the world differently
- The world may be experienced differently than the narratives set within them.
- Are worlds just backgorounds or can they also be things in and of themselves?
- Speculation and fantasy
- New storytelling: making your way in a fragmented, imaginary world.
- **Diagetic** worlds
