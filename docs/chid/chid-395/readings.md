## What is World Building?

### Introduction from _Building Imaginary Worlds_, Wolf

- Media Studies largely overlooks imaginary worlds.
- Imaginary worlds can be massive
- How to experience an imaginary world?
- Traditional storytelling privileges the linearity of narrative. World building, on the other hand, involves an abundance of 'details' which fall off the narrative but help form experience. 
- Imaginary worlds are organized by other forms of structures.

World-building as a Human Activity
- Imaginary worlds are enjoyed by those who build them.
- Compressed time and space
- Perhaps the building of imaginary worlds is innate or serves evolution.
  - Simulation of simulations: imagination without action
  - All cultures create fictional worlds: intrinsically interesting
  - Engage emotion, disengage action
  -  We can decouple fictional worlds from real experiences.
- World-building can begin very early
- Media Studies is the best basis for understanding imaginary worlds. 

Towards a theory of Imaginary Worlds
- "Subcreation" -- a specific form of creation, reliant; 'sub'
- What is the ontological status of fictional worlds? 
- Most analytical approaches focus on form or narrative of content. But what about the world itself as a form of cstudy?
- Supersystem: network of intertextuality which cuts across different modes of image production and appeals to many different groups.

### Introduction from _Extreme Fabulations_, Shaviro
- Kant -- the conditions of possibility.
- Science fiction writing offers a unique way of understanding problems which are intractable.
- Science fiction extrapolates and imagines
- Science fiction performs the movement of _fabulation_.
  - Takes up vagary and indeterminacy.
  - Respects ontological indeterminacy
- Levi-Strauss: myths as synchronic structures, simulaneously existent.
- Narratives are historical; science fictional fabulation is in futurity; counterfactual.
- Henri Bergson: counterfeit of experience / systematically false experience. Thwarts judgement and reason. **Helps us in conditions of excessive certainty.**
- We cannot interpret science fiction through the cold distance of allegory: we need to accept factual contingent and arbitrarily given conditions.
  - Is this materialist? Or is this idealist?
  - Is this training for the acceptance of given myth?
- Hyperserial format
- Imaginary worlds always already prompt convergence culture: stories spill from one media window to another.
- What makes a film into a cult artifact? Eco: completely furnished, encyclopedia.
- The reader must engage with the world differently
- The world may be experienced differently than the narratives set within them.
- Are worlds just backgorounds or can they also be things in and of themselves?
- Speculation and fantasy
- New storytelling: making your way in a fragmented, imaginary world.
- **Diagetic** worlds
  - Zizek: the subject is always diagetic

## Writing Worlds

### "Introduction" and "Worldbuilding" from *Wonderbook*, Jeff Vandermeer
- Some of the most mundane moments of our existence can be saturated witih complexity and wonder.
- Every piece of fiction written is a product of someone's imagination: but it does not settle easily into our reality.
- Subjective interpretation renders the complete replication of reality impossible. (Really? Is reality not but the subjective reproduction of sociality?)
- Even realistic fiction is not really realistic.
- What is a "stance"? What is a "position"?
- We can never truly build a world: we are always creating models of worlds
  - Avoid being "hopelessly lost in details"

Worldview vs. Storyview
- Worldview: what you as the writer know about the world.
- Storyview: what the characters know and believe about the world.
- Unreliable narrator
- Three possible vantage points for characters
  - Native of teh culture -- don't appropriate culture, what is noticed is what is deviant
  - Tourist or visitor
  - Conqueror or colonizer
- There is both freedom and responsibility in worldbuilding
- Characteristics of a well-realized setting
  - Coherent and consistent logic, even if it is absurdist
  - Cause and effect
  - Specific details
  - It both mirrors and deviates from our real world
  - Personal to you
  - Sufficient mystery, unexplored vistas
  - Consistent inconsistency
  - We live in a multicultural world
  - Objects in the narrative act as extended, literal
  - Settings allows for different operational realities in conflict with each other
  - Collective and individual memory
  - Miscommunication and imperfect comprehension: operational realities have incompatibilities
- All settings can be complex -- even the places we may think of as simpler
- Dangers in fantastical world-building:
  - Setting devours the cahracters
  - Fantastical talismans dominate other details
  Detail overwhelms other elements
- Do we want to make the unfamiliar familiar? Do not tamper with the essential strangeness, the irreducible inexplicability.
- Impossibility of knowing anything for certain
- Strangeness is a perspective: not immanent in anything.
- Can we ever grasp the true essence of the world?

### "Imaginary Empires: Transmedia World-Building and Global Capitalism", Hasslerforest
- "Everything is awesome" - LEGO, the cultural logic of global capitalism, capitalist and anticapitalist, practically communist?
- Contradictions which inform fantastic fiction and capitalism.
- Marxist conception of the false consciousness
- Guy Debord, "Society of the Spectacle": capital encapsulates all of lived experience. "Everything is awesome"
- Most interesting part of the Lego Movie: the imaginary world is anticapitalist side-by-side with the promotion of Lego commodification. 
- Lego is a tension between productivity and assembly.
- Hyperdiegesis: a vast and detailed narrative space.
- Storyworlds are coherent kernels of suturing immanent contradictions.
- Transmedia world-building: tension between internally coherent storyworlds and radically heterogenous creative work
  - Empire -- spreads globally through control
  - Globalization -- messy, together while apart

Medical Convergence and Transmedia World-Building
- Henry Jenkins: transmedia storytelling -- narrative distributed across multiple media
  - Is narrative ever complete?
- Intertextuality
- Commercial franchises develop complex fantastic storyworlds
- Convergence culture: boundaries blurred
  1. Transmedia world-building takes place across media
  2. Transmedia world-building involves audience participation
  3. Transmedia world-building is a process that defers narrative closure
- Tension between global capitalism and collaborative, creative development of imaginary worlds

The Politics of World-Building
- Subcreation -- combination of process and product from the Secondary World.
- How to understand authorship and the contributors of the audience to the world?
- Worldness: an unlimited number of narratives can take place. **The storyworld always exceeds the scale of its representation.**
- Jameson: "there is nothing that is not social and historical: indeed, that everything is 'in the last instance' political"
- Fantasy in storyworlds expresses tensions which inform the understanding of our material world.
- Frankfurt School - emphasizes monolithic repetition. Cultural Studies - understands difference
- Storyworlds are continuously expanded and changing
- Maps of spatiotemporal organization: capitalist worldview imposed
- How to negotiate with capitalism's contradictory logic *pleasurably*?
- Cognitive capitalism: relation of capital to labor marked by the hegemony of knowledges and 'diffuse intellectuality'
- Mass culture is not an Adornian 'culture industry'

Empire and Convergence Culture
- *Empire*, Hardt and Negri: globalization as a new phase in the historicity of capitalism.
- Deleuze and Guattari, + Foucault, biopolitics
- The multitude: multitudinous subjectivity does not have inherently revolutionary potential, but will eventually break free from capital's biological enslavement by **creative reappropriation of immaterial labor**
- Imperialism coexists with industrial capitalism: advances of groups over capitalism were made possible by national governments
- Foucault: obsession with the creation of differentiation and disciplining to enhance productivity
  - SUbjectivity under imperialism is produced by institutiosn which produce simultaneous resistance
  - **The boundaries are not being erased**: empire does not establish a territorial center, it is decentered.
- Society has moved away from Foucault towards the Deleuzian "society of control"
  - Society of control: organized through flexible and fluctuating networks
- Convergence culture as a poltiically productive activity
- Empire releases an uncontrollable democratic energy: but also, the imaginative work of transmedia worldbuilding releases this uncontrollable energy.
- Sociocultural practices can play an important role in anticapitalist imaginative work.

Structure and Case Studies
- Fantastic storyworlds articulate the logic of Empire, and allows us to better understand global capitalism.
- **Storyworlds allow us to negotiate the tensions of capitalist culture.**
- Convergence culture's collapse of barriers: how do institutions whic hshape capitalist subjectivity collapse and bleed?
- Worlds breed participatory activity and literacy
- Reterritorialization, rearticulation
- An optimistic quest for storyworlds' radical political potential
- Anticapitalism is undermined by a) the storyworld's multitext, undermining of radicalism and b) level of audience participation
- Can popular culture be appropriated and politicized?
- Storyworlds are never just built by individuals, but by a collective sociality: and the truthood of the contradictions in this sociality reproduce themselves and make themselves apparent.

Personal Questions
- Do audiences have to think about contradiction to realize its radical potential rather than to accept its suturing or axiomatic presence?
  - When do storyworlds become modes of escape? 
  - When do storyworlds become tools of incorporation without consciousness?
  - Are storyworlds a source or a substrate of political radicalism? Must the viewer already be critically conscious?
- Are storyworlds material, materialist?
- Can storyworlds exist for themselves?

## Virtual Worlds and the Potential of Play

### "Envisioning the Virtual", Massumi
- 'Virtual' -- in opposition to reality. The virtual is the unreal.
- Virtual became a synonym for artificial, which itself means illusionary.
- Gilles Deleuze - the virtaul is about force. The virtual is possibility, potential, potentiality.
- THe virtual is a dimension of reality, not its artificial overcoming or representation.
- For Deleuze, it is not virutal reality, but the reality of thev irtual.
- Potential's fulfillment is closed. Potential is recessive and abstract, negative. What is the reality of the abstract?
- The virtual and perception are deeply intertwined.
- That which is real is effectively real.
- The abstract is not in simple opposition to concrete experience.
- Perception is not a question of truth of illusion, but varying modes of reality.
- What is the temporality of potential? It always comes too early or too late, always is too little or too much.
- Optical illusions. What do you call an illusion you cannot not see? It makes a difference, it appears; illusion satisfies a criteria for the real.
  - We are in relational reality.
  - Critical distance and requisite configuration
  - A being of relation adopts perceptible effects
  - The unity and the disjunction enjoy equal imediacy.
- Whitehead: the senuous and the non-sensuous
-  Disjunctive plurality and the singularity.
- What we experience is the binding of different modes, emergent form, supervening form.
- Actual -- 'in act'. THe unity and plurality of its conditions for emergence are dimensions of the actual. Different ways ob eing in an act -- sensuous (necessary reference to space), the nonsensuous (cannot be replaced by the sensuous)
- The non-sensuous is there in excess over the disjunctive plurality which sensuouly conditions its appearance.
- The virtual is the dimension of the actual where it exceeds itself, the excessive dimension.
- The thickness of potential. Sensuous elements in play envelop the nonsensuous past: we find ourselves at the (non)/sensuous collision in act, the actual.
- Nonsensuous dimension of future-past recursivity is recessive. 
- The sensuous is between the virtualities (the ways in which it exceeds itself): one is recessive (infra) and that which is popout (super)
- Tension between infraception and supervention
- The triangle resolves the tensions into its emergence: logical, rather than chronological, time.
- Sensuous elements are not causes, but conditions.
- Disjunctive plurality
- Conditions are not conformal, but formative
- *Tendency*: acquired habit in immediate experience
- Perceptual judgements are abductions: innate habits. Habits are formative vectors. They give experience aim.
- Our eyes form a disjunctive plurality, a tension. Depth emerges from this.
- 'Natural' three-dimensional perception is an 'illusion' -- the abstract emergence of viewing from offset eyes.
- Natural objects of our perception are virtual appearances. 
- Our experience is self-prosthetic: it extends the potential of itself
- Images are virtualized with the emergence of depth perception:
- *Virtual event*: interference of two images which did not occur
- Nonsensuous rendering is necessary to a theory of the virtual. 
  - Infraception of sensuous elements
  - Virtual is about creativity: potential, emergence
- Objects are emergent virtual forms. 
- There are virtual events which perception depends upon.
- Value
  - Differentials: unsustainable tensions, resolutions, actions
  - Life-existential value
  - Maximally abstract virtual reality
  - Value is imperceptible but it makes a difference.
  - Conditioning differentials, disjunctive pluralities -- value is actuality incorporating what exceeds the direct immediacy of its disjunctive plurality.
- Perception of value is nonsensuous and impassive.
- Exceeding itself
- Virtual forms always co-occur.
- Virtual ecology
- Axiological dimension -- the virtual is in universes of values
- Theory of the virtaul is ethical: courses of action, transmutation of indifference into concern for the event. 
- Situational ethics -- ''axiological alchemy of the virtual'

Personal questions
- Not still quite clear about this ethical dimension

### "A Game of Cat's Cradle", Haraway
- Emergencies, crises -- these are not the exception but the rule.
- We must bring about real emergency.
- Nature is commonplace: nature is not a choice, but inheritance.
- Nature roots me into itself: I cannot escape nature, the shared place, the place in common.
- Technoscience: about reconfiguring what counts as nature.
- Antiracist feminist theory and cultural studies
- What is normal, natural in technoscience?
- Queering what counts as nature.
- How not to replicate the worlds we analyze?

Cat's Cradle
- Feminist, multicultural, antiracist technoscience projects transgress the borders between disciplines.
- What life can flourish in war zones?
Textual reading is never enough, even if the world is the text: we need intervention and narration, world-building -- not just participating in its processes as interpreters.
- Critical theory: unmask lies of the established disorder which appears as normal.
- Optical metaphors, critical vision
- Techoscience: inherits the negativity of critical theory without relying on Marxist humanism.
- Cracking the possibility for belief in better worlds -- Harding's "strong objectivity"
- High theory is pushing critical negativity to the extreme.
- Diffration: making a difference in the world
- Two fibers: intersecting threads, implosion
- Actors, agencies, actants
- (Non)humanity -- a product of relation, relationality: humanity is not self-evident
- Scientific realism: nature and society are foundationally there, like an objective totalitarian socialism.
- Categorical purity
- The game of cat's cradle
- Cultural studies: bodily and cultural production, comparative culture, hegemonies -- Marxism, psychoanalysis, Gramsci, Frankfurt school
- Feminist, Multicultural, Antiracism: situation is never self-evident or concrete, but critical: there is no origin
- Science studies: science in action and in the making, labor, the formation of science
- Knotted analytical practice: cat's cradle as collaborative,local and global
- A tangled mess
- Unified totality
- String theories of cat's cradle are games of complex processes and culturally interesting patterns.
- "Bodies that matter"

### *Parallel Botany*, Leo Lionni
*Morphology*

- Plants are matterless
- What is a plant? What is plantness?
- Plantness is part of a larger concept of organicity: what is the basis of nature?
- How can we tell natural things from human ones?
- We know when something has grown.
- Biophilosophy ... haha
- Growth -- is it really about growth? Or more of decay and whittling?
- Organisch: a harmonious complex of organs
- What typifies the forms of nature which man's products do not have?
- Technology: objects of use into objects of possession, mechanical into ritual
- The geometric impulse: man projects things into concrete terms
- Organic - authenticity.
- What is an organic thing?
- Human manipulation ends with organic forms, or nature destroys the original forms of man-made objects.
- Size, too, is dependent
- We accept dubious dimensions without verification: accepting images as reality.
- Plants and a dialgoue with the world: personal identity, survival.
- Many biological 'natural' phenomena elude rational explanation. 

*The Woodland Tweezers*
- Woodland tweezers: social plants.
- Parallel plants: cannot be moved; turn to dust in contact.

## Other

### *A Grammar of the Multitude*, Paolo Virno
We, the Multitude

Introduction, p. 21 (9)
- The multitude is more useful than the people as an analysis of the contemporary public.
- Hobbes -- people, Spinoza -- multitude
- Spinoza: the plurality which persists as such. 
- Hobbes: people and the State, reciprocally constitutive
- Multitude: inherent to the state of nature; before the State, there were the many. Multitude shuns political unity and authority, resists the single.
  - The multitude is anti-state, but also anti-people
  - But how has the multitude survived?
- The bifuraction between the public and the private: the private is the personal, deprived of the public.
  - The multitude is concealed in individuals: the remainder of multiplications and divisions; and not conceivable in the democratic socialist thought.
- The dichotomies: public-private, collective-individual, are dying. The category of the citizen, of the producer -- failed.
- The multitude is the middle region. **The multitude does not conflict witht he One, it redefines it**; the unity is no longer the State or universal commonality: it is the base which authorizes differentiation to the many as the individualization of the universal.
- Three approaches to the many
  - Hobbesian: dialectic of fear and security.
  - The multitude and the failing tripartite of labor, politics, thought
  - Subjectivity of the multitude

Forms of Dread and Refuge, p. 29 (12)
