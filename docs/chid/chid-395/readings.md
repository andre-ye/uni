## What is World Building?

### Introduction from _Building Imaginary Worlds_, Wolf

- Media Studies largely overlooks imaginary worlds.
- Imaginary worlds can be massive
- How to experience an imaginary world?
- Traditional storytelling privileges the linearity of narrative. World building, on the other hand, involves an abundance of 'details' which fall off the narrative but help form experience. 
- Imaginary worlds are organized by other forms of structures.

World-building as a Human Activity
- Imaginary worlds are enjoyed by those who build them.
- Compressed time and space
- Perhaps the building of imaginary worlds is innate or serves evolution.
  - Simulation of simulations: imagination without action
  - All cultures create fictional worlds: intrinsically interesting
  - Engage emotion, disengage action
  -  We can decouple fictional worlds from real experiences.
- World-building can begin very early
- Media Studies is the best basis for understanding imaginary worlds. 

Towards a theory of Imaginary Worlds
- "Subcreation" -- a specific form of creation, reliant; 'sub'
- What is the ontological status of fictional worlds? 
- Most analytical approaches focus on form or narrative of content. But what about the world itself as a form of cstudy?
- Supersystem: network of intertextuality which cuts across different modes of image production and appeals to many different groups.

### Introduction from _Extreme Fabulations_, Shaviro
- Kant -- the conditions of possibility.
- Science fiction writing offers a unique way of understanding problems which are intractable.
- Science fiction extrapolates and imagines
- Science fiction performs the movement of _fabulation_.
  - Takes up vagary and indeterminacy.
  - Respects ontological indeterminacy
- Levi-Strauss: myths as synchronic structures, simulaneously existent.
- Narratives are historical; science fictional fabulation is in futurity; counterfactual.
- Henri Bergson: counterfeit of experience / systematically false experience. Thwarts judgement and reason. **Helps us in conditions of excessive certainty.**
- We cannot interpret science fiction through the cold distance of allegory: we need to accept factual contingent and arbitrarily given conditions.
  - Is this materialist? Or is this idealist?
  - Is this training for the acceptance of given myth?
- Hyperserial format
- Imaginary worlds always already prompt convergence culture: stories spill from one media window to another.
- What makes a film into a cult artifact? Eco: completely furnished, encyclopedia.
- The reader must engage with the world differently
- The world may be experienced differently than the narratives set within them.
- Are worlds just backgorounds or can they also be things in and of themselves?
- Speculation and fantasy
- New storytelling: making your way in a fragmented, imaginary world.
- **Diagetic** worlds
  - Zizek: the subject is always diagetic

## Writing Worlds

### "Introduction" and "Worldbuilding" from *Wonderbook*, Jeff Vandermeer
- Some of the most mundane moments of our existence can be saturated witih complexity and wonder.
- Every piece of fiction written is a product of someone's imagination: but it does not settle easily into our reality.
- Subjective interpretation renders the complete replication of reality impossible. (Really? Is reality not but the subjective reproduction of sociality?)
- Even realistic fiction is not really realistic.
- What is a "stance"? What is a "position"?
- We can never truly build a world: we are always creating models of worlds
  - Avoid being "hopelessly lost in details"

Worldview vs. Storyview
- Worldview: what you as the writer know about the world.
- Storyview: what the characters know and believe about the world.
- Unreliable narrator
- Three possible vantage points for characters
  - Native of teh culture -- don't appropriate culture, what is noticed is what is deviant
  - Tourist or visitor
  - Conqueror or colonizer
- There is both freedom and responsibility in worldbuilding
- Characteristics of a well-realized setting
  - Coherent and consistent logic, even if it is absurdist
  - Cause and effect
  - Specific details
  - It both mirrors and deviates from our real world
  - Personal to you
  - Sufficient mystery, unexplored vistas
  - Consistent inconsistency
  - We live in a multicultural world
  - Objects in the narrative act as extended, literal
  - Settings allows for different operational realities in conflict with each other
  - Collective and individual memory
  - Miscommunication and imperfect comprehension: operational realities have incompatibilities
- All settings can be complex -- even the places we may think of as simpler
- Dangers in fantastical world-building:
  - Setting devours the cahracters
  - Fantastical talismans dominate other details
  Detail overwhelms other elements
- Do we want to make the unfamiliar familiar? Do not tamper with the essential strangeness, the irreducible inexplicability.
- Impossibility of knowing anything for certain
- Strangeness is a perspective: not immanent in anything.
- Can we ever grasp the true essence of the world?

### "Imaginary Empires: Transmedia World-Building and Global Capitalism", Hasslerforest
- "Everything is awesome" - LEGO, the cultural logic of global capitalism, capitalist and anticapitalist, practically communist?
- Contradictions which inform fantastic fiction and capitalism.
- Marxist conception of the false consciousness
- Guy Debord, "Society of the Spectacle": capital encapsulates all of lived experience. "Everything is awesome"
- Most interesting part of the Lego Movie: the imaginary world is anticapitalist side-by-side with the promotion of Lego commodification. 
- Lego is a tension between productivity and assembly.
- Hyperdiegesis: a vast and detailed narrative space.
- Storyworlds are coherent kernels of suturing immanent contradictions.
- Transmedia world-building: tension between internally coherent storyworlds and radically heterogenous creative work
  - Empire -- spreads globally through control
  - Globalization -- messy, together while apart

Medical Convergence and Transmedia World-Building
- Henry Jenkins: transmedia storytelling -- narrative distributed across multiple media
  - Is narrative ever complete?
- Intertextuality
- Commercial franchises develop complex fantastic storyworlds
- Convergence culture: boundaries blurred
  1. Transmedia world-building takes place across media
  2. Transmedia world-building involves audience participation
  3. Transmedia world-building is a process that defers narrative closure
- Tension between global capitalism and collaborative, creative development of imaginary worlds

The Politics of World-Building
- Subcreation -- combination of process and product from the Secondary World.
- How to understand authorship and the contributors of the audience to the world?
- Worldness: an unlimited number of narratives can take place. **The storyworld always exceeds the scale of its representation.**
- Jameson: "there is nothing that is not social and historical: indeed, that everything is 'in the last instance' political"
- Fantasy in storyworlds expresses tensions which inform the understanding of our material world.
- Frankfurt School - emphasizes monolithic repetition. Cultural Studies - understands difference
- Storyworlds are continuously expanded and changing
- Maps of spatiotemporal organization: capitalist worldview imposed
- How to negotiate with capitalism's contradictory logic *pleasurably*?
- Cognitive capitalism: relation of capital to labor marked by the hegemony of knowledges and 'diffuse intellectuality'
- Mass culture is not an Adornian 'culture industry'

Empire and Convergence Culture
- *Empire*, Hardt and Negri: globalization as a new phase in the historicity of capitalism.
- Deleuze and Guattari, + Foucault, biopolitics
- The multitude: multitudinous subjectivity does not have inherently revolutionary potential, but will eventually break free from capital's biological enslavement by **creative reappropriation of immaterial labor**
- Imperialism coexists with industrial capitalism: advances of groups over capitalism were made possible by national governments
- Foucault: obsession with the creation of differentiation and disciplining to enhance productivity
  - SUbjectivity under imperialism is produced by institutiosn which produce simultaneous resistance
  - **The boundaries are not being erased**: empire does not establish a territorial center, it is decentered.
- Society has moved away from Foucault towards the Deleuzian "society of control"
  - Society of control: organized through flexible and fluctuating networks
- Convergence culture as a poltiically productive activity
- Empire releases an uncontrollable democratic energy: but also, the imaginative work of transmedia worldbuilding releases this uncontrollable energy.
- Sociocultural practices can play an important role in anticapitalist imaginative work.

Structure and Case Studies
- Fantastic storyworlds articulate the logic of Empire, and allows us to better understand global capitalism.
- **Storyworlds allow us to negotiate the tensions of capitalist culture.**
- Convergence culture's collapse of barriers: how do institutions whic hshape capitalist subjectivity collapse and bleed?
- Worlds breed participatory activity and literacy
- Reterritorialization, rearticulation
- An optimistic quest for storyworlds' radical political potential
- Anticapitalism is undermined by a) the storyworld's multitext, undermining of radicalism and b) level of audience participation
- Can popular culture be appropriated and politicized?
- Storyworlds are never just built by individuals, but by a collective sociality: and the truthood of the contradictions in this sociality reproduce themselves and make themselves apparent.

Personal Questions
- Do audiences have to think about contradiction to realize its radical potential rather than to accept its suturing or axiomatic presence?
  - When do storyworlds become modes of escape? 
  - When do storyworlds become tools of incorporation without consciousness?
  - Are storyworlds a source or a substrate of political radicalism? Must the viewer already be critically conscious?
- Are storyworlds material, materialist?
- Can storyworlds exist for themselves?

## Virtual Worlds and the Potential of Play

### "Envisioning the Virtual", Massumi
- 'Virtual' -- in opposition to reality. The virtual is the unreal.
- Virtual became a synonym for artificial, which itself means illusionary.
- Gilles Deleuze - the virtaul is about force. The virtual is possibility, potential, potentiality.
- THe virtual is a dimension of reality, not its artificial overcoming or representation.
- For Deleuze, it is not virutal reality, but the reality of thev irtual.
- Potential's fulfillment is closed. Potential is recessive and abstract, negative. What is the reality of the abstract?
- The virtual and perception are deeply intertwined.
- That which is real is effectively real.
- The abstract is not in simple opposition to concrete experience.
- Perception is not a question of truth of illusion, but varying modes of reality.
- What is the temporality of potential? It always comes too early or too late, always is too little or too much.
- Optical illusions. What do you call an illusion you cannot not see? It makes a difference, it appears; illusion satisfies a criteria for the real.
  - We are in relational reality.
  - Critical distance and requisite configuration
  - A being of relation adopts perceptible effects
  - The unity and the disjunction enjoy equal imediacy.
- Whitehead: the sensuous and the non-sensuous
-  Disjunctive plurality and the singularity.
- What we experience is the binding of different modes, emergent form, supervening form.
- Actual -- 'in act'. THe unity and plurality of its conditions for emergence are dimensions of the actual. Different ways ob eing in an act -- sensuous (necessary reference to space), the nonsensuous (cannot be replaced by the sensuous)
- The non-sensuous is there in excess over the disjunctive plurality which sensuouly conditions its appearance.
- The virtual is the dimension of the actual where it exceeds itself, the excessive dimension.
- The thickness of potential. Sensuous elements in play envelop the nonsensuous past: we find ourselves at the (non)/sensuous collision in act, the actual.
- Nonsensuous dimension of future-past recursivity is recessive. 
- The sensuous is between the virtualities (the ways in which it exceeds itself): one is recessive (infra) and that which is popout (super)
- Tension between infraception and supervention
- The triangle resolves the tensions into its emergence: logical, rather than chronological, time.
- Sensuous elements are not causes, but conditions.
- Disjunctive plurality
- Conditions are not conformal, but formative
- *Tendency*: acquired habit in immediate experience
- Perceptual judgements are abductions: innate habits. Habits are formative vectors. They give experience aim.
- Our eyes form a disjunctive plurality, a tension. Depth emerges from this.
- 'Natural' three-dimensional perception is an 'illusion' -- the abstract emergence of viewing from offset eyes.
- Natural objects of our perception are virtual appearances. 
- Our experience is self-prosthetic: it extends the potential of itself
- Images are virtualized with the emergence of depth perception:
- *Virtual event*: interference of two images which did not occur
- Nonsensuous rendering is necessary to a theory of the virtual. 
  - Infraception of sensuous elements
  - Virtual is about creativity: potential, emergence
- Objects are emergent virtual forms. 
- There are virtual events which perception depends upon.
- Value
  - Differentials: unsustainable tensions, resolutions, actions
  - Life-existential value
  - Maximally abstract virtual reality
  - Value is imperceptible but it makes a difference.
  - Conditioning differentials, disjunctive pluralities -- value is actuality incorporating what exceeds the direct immediacy of its disjunctive plurality.
- Perception of value is nonsensuous and impassive.
- Exceeding itself
- Virtual forms always co-occur.
- Virtual ecology
- Axiological dimension -- the virtual is in universes of values
- Theory of the virtaul is ethical: courses of action, transmutation of indifference into concern for the event. 
- Situational ethics -- ''axiological alchemy of the virtual'

Personal questions
- Not still quite clear about this ethical dimension

### "A Game of Cat's Cradle", Haraway
- Emergencies, crises -- these are not the exception but the rule.
- We must bring about real emergency.
- Nature is commonplace: nature is not a choice, but inheritance.
- Nature roots me into itself: I cannot escape nature, the shared place, the place in common.
- Technoscience: about reconfiguring what counts as nature.
- Antiracist feminist theory and cultural studies
- What is normal, natural in technoscience?
- Queering what counts as nature.
- How not to replicate the worlds we analyze?

Cat's Cradle
- Feminist, multicultural, antiracist technoscience projects transgress the borders between disciplines.
- What life can flourish in war zones?
Textual reading is never enough, even if the world is the text: we need intervention and narration, world-building -- not just participating in its processes as interpreters.
- Critical theory: unmask lies of the established disorder which appears as normal.
- Optical metaphors, critical vision
- Techoscience: inherits the negativity of critical theory without relying on Marxist humanism.
- Cracking the possibility for belief in better worlds -- Harding's "strong objectivity"
- High theory is pushing critical negativity to the extreme.
- Diffration: making a difference in the world
- Two fibers: intersecting threads, implosion
- Actors, agencies, actants
- (Non)humanity -- a product of relation, relationality: humanity is not self-evident
- Scientific realism: nature and society are foundationally there, like an objective totalitarian socialism.
- Categorical purity
- The game of cat's cradle
- Cultural studies: bodily and cultural production, comparative culture, hegemonies -- Marxism, psychoanalysis, Gramsci, Frankfurt school
- Feminist, Multicultural, Antiracism: situation is never self-evident or concrete, but critical: there is no origin
- Science studies: science in action and in the making, labor, the formation of science
- Knotted analytical practice: cat's cradle as collaborative,local and global
- A tangled mess
- Unified totality
- String theories of cat's cradle are games of complex processes and culturally interesting patterns.
- "Bodies that matter"

### *Parallel Botany*, Leo Lionni
*Morphology*

- Plants are matterless
- What is a plant? What is plantness?
- Plantness is part of a larger concept of organicity: what is the basis of nature?
- How can we tell natural things from human ones?
- We know when something has grown.
- Biophilosophy ... haha
- Growth -- is it really about growth? Or more of decay and whittling?
- Organisch: a harmonious complex of organs
- What typifies the forms of nature which man's products do not have?
- Technology: objects of use into objects of possession, mechanical into ritual
- The geometric impulse: man projects things into concrete terms
- Organic - authenticity.
- What is an organic thing?
- Human manipulation ends with organic forms, or nature destroys the original forms of man-made objects.
- Size, too, is dependent
- We accept dubious dimensions without verification: accepting images as reality.
- Plants and a dialgoue with the world: personal identity, survival.
- Many biological 'natural' phenomena elude rational explanation. 

*The Woodland Tweezers*
- Woodland tweezers: social plants.
- Parallel plants: cannot be moved; turn to dust in contact.
- Illusion of self-determination: plants live a 'community life', 'monotonous'
- The game of Go
- Mystical and aesthetic aspiration -- foreign to Western scientisim
- Choice of location is definitive

## Envisioning Nature -- Modeling and Knowledge

### _Into the Technical Universe of Images_, Vilem Flusser

To Abstract
- Technical images -- photographs, films, etc., replacements for *linear texts*
- What happens when images supplant texts? -- two-dimensions rupture from one (historical to spatial).
- Linear texts: bear history
- Perhaps linear texts are a moment in our history and we are returning to two dimensions: but Flusser argues otherwise.  Technical images are not prehistoric but posthistorical: *without dimension*.
- Flusser's rungs:
  1. Four dimensions: concrete experience
  2. Three dimensions: objects, things
  3. Two dimensions: cave paintings, mediation
  4. One dimension: linear texts, writing
  5. Dimensionless: collapse nto particles, technical images
- Technical images are a different form of media.
- Each rung corresponds to spaces which must be crossed, from one universe to another.
- Images have no depth; they are only visible.
- Linear texts: grasping; representations; concepts
- Both texts and images are mediations.
- We recognize rules of play: lost coherence, disintegration.
- Traditional vs technical images: observations of objects vs computations of concepts. -- *hallucinatory power*

To Imagine
- Split between object and subject, anthropologically: subject withdrew into subjectivity to understand objectivity
- Images are models for actions. They only show surfaces, but they still show relationships.
- Every observation is subjective, and every observation is momentary
- Images need to be stabilized to be made models fro actions
- Cave paintings: an activity of symbols; symbolic content, imaginative consciousness in the universe of traditional images
- Codes -- symbols linked to content. Initiates -- decipher symbols.
- Is there a 'history of images'? 
- Original images attempted to be as true to images as possible.
- Makers try to reduce subjectivity: to retain the objective conditions
- Prehistoric universe (universe of traditional images)
- Linear texts: now emerges the history of images.
- Technical images are on a different level of consciousness
- Visualization as different from depiction

To Make Concrete
- Dimensionless level: post-history. 
- The universe is quanta -- bits of information. 
- Particles do not follow rules
- We can't live in an empty and abstract universe. So we make it concrete.
  - Integrate, differentiate
- Technical images: consolidate particles; turn information into images. We need methods to grasp the ungraspable.
- Apparatuses are not intractable: they can simulate thought 
- A technical image is a blindly realized possibility.
- Production of technical images happens in a field of possibilities (virtual?)
- Possibility is the emergence of consciosuness.
- Particle universes tend towards disinformation
- There are improbable situations everywhere in the universe
- Can large computers futurize improbable situations
- Apparatuses are part of a search for eternal life: to produce and distribute information
- Technical images are resevoirs of immortality
- Improbable situations become more probable with time. 
- 'programmed accidents'
- The universe runs past the programmed task; the apparatus continues with its programmed tasks
- Automation: self-governing computation of accidental events. 
- Over time, the apparatus becomes liberated from humans.
- Unintended results -- the challenge to automated production of technical images. 
- The appratus does as the photographer desires, but the photographer can only desire waht the apparatus can do.
  - The tools constrain the wishes of the tool-wielder.
- Apparatuses generate informative situations automatically. 
- Technical images come from a complex relationship between the inventor and the manipulator of the apparatus.
- Technical images: programming computation, then deprogramming to become informative. To rise from no dimensions to two dimensions: abstraction to concreteness.
- Every surface is infinitely many particles. 
- Traditional image makers direct from objects to a surface (concrete, then abstract). But technical images are from particles to surfaces (abstract, then concrete).

To Envision
- Technical images are envisioned surfaces. The basic construction of particles is the same: they are surfaces computed from particles.
- Tension between looking and observing in technical images
- Technical images are very different from standard objects in the objective world
- Wholeness is an illusion
- The theory precedes the practice: without the theory, there can be no practice. 
- Concrete experience: visualized out of abstractions
- Envision: the capacity to step from the particulate universe to the concrete
- Technical images are symptoms of chemical and electronic processes: objective depictions of events in the particle universe.
- Technical images require critical distance. 
- Should we praise the superficiality of images, the truth itself?
- Envisioners are superficial people.
- To visualize, we must have a mistrust of deep explanation. A contempt for depth.
- Envisioners are constrained tightly by the machine, more than a writer. It is not about writing texts, but about building from within.
  - Envisioners are freed from the pressure for depth.
- Superficiality gives new powers for invention
- Envisioning: to make concreteness out of the abstractness.
- Envisions offer us the possibility to experience the world concretely in the most extreme edge of abstraction.
- It does not make sense to distinguish fiction and reality, illusion and disillusion.
- We should abandon true-false, real-artificial, and so on -- instead, it is about the concrete and the abstract. 
- Science and technology eroded the objective world and bathed us in illusion.
- "suicidal view of Western society"

To Signify
- Semiotics: sign and meaning
- What do technical images indicate? Where do they point? What is their meaning?
- Before generation: technical images capture particles in the environment.
- Depictions vs models: what is, and what could be.
- It is impossible to distinguish between a representation and a model.
- Models are representations: sketches of concepts.
- All technical images are visualizations.
- A photographer envisions objects, not as they are but as they should be: the object is the effect of the image.
- Technical images -- what do they mean? More like: how is the visualizing gesture oriented?
- Historical consciousness, textual: "Nature speaks". The world is an open text. It is our job to interpret it. But in the universe of particles, this is impossible. There is nothing to decode. Meaning is dead. Now we point our finger at the world. We project meaning on the world. We give absurdity meaning.
- Traditional images: walls. Cave walls, peoples' houses. But the universe of technical images has no substrate, no such surface. 
- Technical images don't depict anything: they project
- Traditional images are mirrors: it makes sense to ask what they mean. But technical images are projections: we give them meaning. It is not, what do they mean -- it is, why do they do what they show?
- Technical images are projections: they are not representations but signs to things outwards -- it is the projector which is the criticism.
- **Technical images show us a way we may be directed**.
- **Vectors of meaning** -- they indicate only a direction, signify instructional programs

## Other

### *A Grammar of the Multitude*, Paolo Virno
We, the Multitude

Introduction, p. 21 (9)
- The multitude is more useful than the people as an analysis of the contemporary public.
- Hobbes -- people, Spinoza -- multitude
- Spinoza: the plurality which persists as such. 
- Hobbes: people and the State, reciprocally constitutive
- Multitude: inherent to the state of nature; before the State, there were the many. Multitude shuns political unity and authority, resists the single.
  - The multitude is anti-state, but also anti-people
  - But how has the multitude survived?
- The bifuraction between the public and the private: the private is the personal, deprived of the public.
  - The multitude is concealed in individuals: the remainder of multiplications and divisions; and not conceivable in the democratic socialist thought.
- The dichotomies: public-private, collective-individual, are dying. The category of the citizen, of the producer -- failed.
- The multitude is the middle region. **The multitude does not conflict witht he One, it redefines it**; the unity is no longer the State or universal commonality: it is the base which authorizes differentiation to the many as the individualization of the universal.
- Three approaches to the many
  - Hobbesian: dialectic of fear and security.
  - The multitude and the failing tripartite of labor, politics, thought
  - Subjectivity of the multitude
