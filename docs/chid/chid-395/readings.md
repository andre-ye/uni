## What is World Building?

### Introduction from _Building Imaginary Worlds_, Wolf

- Media Studies largely overlooks imaginary worlds.
- Imaginary worlds can be massive
- How to experience an imaginary world?
- Traditional storytelling privileges the linearity of narrative. World building, on the other hand, involves an abundance of 'details' which fall off the narrative but help form experience. 
- Imaginary worlds are organized by other forms of structures.

World-building as a Human Activity
- Imaginary worlds are enjoyed by those who build them.
- Compressed time and space
- Perhaps the building of imaginary worlds is innate or serves evolution.
  - Simulation of simulations: imagination without action
  - All cultures create fictional worlds: intrinsically interesting
  - Engage emotion, disengage action
  -  We can decouple fictional worlds from real experiences.
- World-building can begin very early
- Media Studies is the best basis for understanding imaginary worlds. 

Towards a theory of Imaginary Worlds
- "Subcreation" -- a specific form of creation, reliant; 'sub'
- What is the ontological status of fictional worlds? 
- Most analytical approaches focus on form or narrative of content. But what about the world itself as a form of cstudy?
- Supersystem: network of intertextuality which cuts across different modes of image production and appeals to many different groups.

### Introduction from _Extreme Fabulations_, Shaviro
- Kant -- the conditions of possibility.
- Science fiction writing offers a unique way of understanding problems which are intractable.
- Science fiction extrapolates and imagines
- Science fiction performs the movement of _fabulation_.
  - Takes up vagary and indeterminacy.
  - Respects ontological indeterminacy
- Levi-Strauss: myths as synchronic structures, simulaneously existent.
- Narratives are historical; science fictional fabulation is in futurity; counterfactual.
- Henri Bergson: counterfeit of experience / systematically false experience. Thwarts judgement and reason. **Helps us in conditions of excessive certainty.**
- We cannot interpret science fiction through the cold distance of allegory: we need to accept factual contingent and arbitrarily given conditions.
  - Is this materialist? Or is this idealist?
  - Is this training for the acceptance of given myth?
- Hyperserial format
- Imaginary worlds always already prompt convergence culture: stories spill from one media window to another.
- What makes a film into a cult artifact? Eco: completely furnished, encyclopedia.
- The reader must engage with the world differently
- The world may be experienced differently than the narratives set within them.
- Are worlds just backgorounds or can they also be things in and of themselves?
- Speculation and fantasy
- New storytelling: making your way in a fragmented, imaginary world.
- **Diagetic** worlds
  - Zizek: the subject is always diagetic

## Writing Worlds

### "Introduction" and "Worldbuilding" from *Wonderbook*, Jeff Vandermeer
- Some of the most mundane moments of our existence can be saturated witih complexity and wonder.
- Every piece of fiction written is a product of someone's imagination: but it does not settle easily into our reality.
- Subjective interpretation renders the complete replication of reality impossible. (Really? Is reality not but the subjective reproduction of sociality?)
- Even realistic fiction is not really realistic.
- What is a "stance"? What is a "position"?
- We can never truly build a world: we are always creating models of worlds
  - Avoid being "hopelessly lost in details"

Worldview vs. Storyview
- Worldview: what you as the writer know about the world.
- Storyview: what the characters know and believe about the world.
- Unreliable narrator
- Three possible vantage points for characters
  - Native of teh culture -- don't appropriate culture, what is noticed is what is deviant
  - Tourist or visitor
  - Conqueror or colonizer
- There is both freedom and responsibility in worldbuilding
- Characteristics of a well-realized setting
  - Coherent and consistent logic, even if it is absurdist
  - Cause and effect
  - Specific details
  - It both mirrors and deviates from our real world
  - Personal to you
  - Sufficient mystery, unexplored vistas
  - Consistent inconsistency
  - We live in a multicultural world
  - Objects in the narrative act as extended, literal
  - Settings allows for different operational realities in conflict with each other
  - Collective and individual memory
  - Miscommunication and imperfect comprehension: operational realities have incompatibilities
- All settings can be complex -- even the places we may think of as simpler
- Dangers in fantastical world-building:
  - Setting devours the cahracters
  - Fantastical talismans dominate other details
  Detail overwhelms other elements
- Do we want to make the unfamiliar familiar? Do not tamper with the essential strangeness, the irreducible inexplicability.
- Impossibility of knowing anything for certain
- Strangeness is a perspective: not immanent in anything.
- Can we ever grasp the true essence of the world?

### "Imaginary Empires: Transmedia World-Building and Global Capitalism", Hasslerforest
- "Everything is awesome" - LEGO, the cultural logic of global capitalism, capitalist and anticapitalist, practically communist?
- Contradictions which inform fantastic fiction and capitalism.
- Marxist conception of the false consciousness
- Guy Debord, "Society of the Spectacle": capital encapsulates all of lived experience. "Everything is awesome"
- Most interesting part of the Lego Movie: the imaginary world is anticapitalist side-by-side with the promotion of Lego commodification. 
- Lego is a tension between productivity and assembly.
- Hyperdiegesis: a vast and detailed narrative space.
- Storyworlds are coherent kernels of suturing immanent contradictions.
- Transmedia world-building
