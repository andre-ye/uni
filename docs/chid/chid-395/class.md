## Week 1 Tuesday

- The promise of speculative thinking
- World building is about the world itself -- not necessarily about the narratives.
- A different way of engaging with the world and watching things.
- Phillip Thurtle - began work in molecular biology, interested in the relaitonship between molecular and organismic biology. But afterwards, realized that not having the conversations he wanted to have. H&PS at Stanford. 7 disciplines
- Will get a greater sense of importance, context for the world and the work you do.

What is a world?
- Infinity minus one
- An immanent narrative
- Lacan -- conceptions of the real happen before our symbolic engagement with it.
- We cannot engage with the world without the symbolic -- already mediated with our symbolic experience
- World as perception -- perception is our way of engagement with the world.
- The world is engaging with us in a certain way.
- Does the world need to contain a subject to exist?
- Worlds are about relationships: even though there may not be subjects, there are always relationships.
- Omnipresent but never seen -- worlds always support what is happening, but we rarely talk about it.
- World is the capacity for immanent narrative
- Narrative vs story
- *Time and Narrative*
- Worlds exist across stories and platforms.
- Worlds are generative: worlds are about relationships, between subjects, subject and object, objects, environments, data
- What worlds are constructed through a database?
- Imaginative worlds do not occur within a vacuum. Not a form of escape.
- Every escape has an orientation. From phenomenology
- Relationships are the precondition for everything to exist.
- Preconditions for subjects and objects -- the virtual.
- The ways imaginative worlds are coupled with lived world creates politics.
- A world is always becoming

## Week 2 Thursday: The Power of the False
- Narratives and windows
- Narrative as relation between the viewer and the window.
- Do we really see windows? Or do we see the world? 
- "I see the pool tiles because of the water, not in spite of it" -- the pool isn't contained in the pool
- Are we really engaging with the window? Or the illusion that there is no window
- Do we want to overcome our situation in the world?
- Hegel, is there a difference between embodying and changing: the future comes about through synthesis. The dialectic is a model of time, of history. Overcoming contradictions. Can we think about time passing, futurity, which is not about antagonistic synthesis. Embodying rather than overcoming contradiction.
- A delicate balance between overcoming and embodying. What does this mean? How do futures occur? What makes time progress? Historicity
- The future is a paradox: an imagination.
- Can we imagine a future which is not a projection? We need some sort of imagination.
- The future is anti-truth: it is a fabulation. We have to make things up. 
- We have to rely upon what we know to explain something which goes beyond us. 
- Imagination does not exist in a vacuum.
- Can imaginary worlds exist as a means for themselves?
- What counts as real? A reciprocal dependency. 
- How much is reality? What is the real?
- Narcissus: a rationalistic trope, you fall in love with what is represented? Look at the mirror, put it in a world. What's the world for the mirror.
- The power of the false: from Gilles Deleuze. Confounded ideas about what truth is.
- Two themes: imaginative worlds and fabulation
- The importance of fabulation: the act of inventing or relating false or fantastic tales
- truth as timeless, eternal, non-temporal, truth as faithful representation, as 'real'.
- Problems with formulation: trauma is too painful to represent; does not represent change, dynamic systems, what is unrepresented?
  - Trauma invades representation, that which we cannot understand, which we must wrestle with: the unrepresentable
  - This idea of truth only exists in non-temporal space; it doesn't work in temporal worlds.
  - The fantastic is often a reference to a change in scale.
  - No world happens on the same scale. 
  - Things which haunt us which we cannot see -- the spectre, the ghost in the machine
- Occult (that which is not seen but which is felt) and trickster wisdom (something nonlinear, nonlinear events; beyond projection of the now into the future)
- Journalists build truth through representational veracity.
- Tropes and ways to think about fantastical stories: what is the truth within them?
- In the act of world-building, the logics come out: we have to build the world to understand the trick.
- Imagination is not linear (projection -- linear algebra); it exceeds the characters, narratives, environments; it is immersive rather than causal (immersive is larger than causal: an environment for a subject, as opposed to a relationship between a subject and an object).
- Imagination points towards something much larger than what we get right now.
- Often we need to reconstitute the world in order to understand it. Not by answering a question, but by building a world.
- knowing through change instead of critique
- There is a kernel of fantasy at the very heart of our experience.
- The point of science fiction isn't predictive: it is to create a world under which certain predictions can or cannot come true.
- Can we recognize the imaginative in our daily lives and our most mundane arguments? That is the world.
- Philosophically: speculation
- Dorothy Napangardi, Sandhills in Minia mina
- Lines aren't just lines; worlds are nonlinear.
