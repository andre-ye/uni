## Week 1 Tuesday

- The promise of speculative thinking
- World building is about the world itself -- not necessarily about the narratives.
- A different way of engaging with the world and watching things.
- Phillip Thurtle - began work in molecular biology, interested in the relaitonship between molecular and organismic biology. But afterwards, realized that not having the conversations he wanted to have. H&PS at Stanford. 7 disciplines
- Will get a greater sense of importance, context for the world and the work you do.

What is a world?
- Infinity minus one
- An immanent narrative
- Lacan -- conceptions of the real happen before our symbolic engagement with it.
- We cannot engage with the world without the symbolic -- already mediated with our symbolic experience
- World as perception -- perception is our way of engagement with the world.
- The world is engaging with us in a certain way.
- Does the world need to contain a subject to exist?
- Worlds are about relationships: even though there may not be subjects, there are always relationships.
- Omnipresent but never seen -- worlds always support what is happening, but we rarely talk about it.
- World is the capacity for immanent narrative
- Narrative vs story
- *Time and Narrative*
- Worlds exist across stories and platforms.
- Worlds are generative: worlds are about relationships, between subjects, subject and object, objects, environments, data
- What worlds are constructed through a database?
- Imaginative worlds do not occur within a vacuum. Not a form of escape.
- Every escape has an orientation. From phenomenology
- Relationships are the precondition for everything to exist.
- Preconditions for subjects and objects -- the virtual.
- The ways imaginative worlds are coupled with lived world creates politics.
- A world is always becoming

## Week 2 Thursday: The Power of the False
- Narratives and windows
- Narrative as relation between the viewer and the window.
- Do we really see windows? Or do we see the world? 
- "I see the pool tiles because of the water, not in spite of it" -- the pool isn't contained in the pool
- Are we really engaging with the window? Or the illusion that there is no window
- Do we want to overcome our situation in the world?
- Hegel, is there a difference between embodying and changing: the future comes about through synthesis. The dialectic is a model of time, of history. Overcoming contradictions. Can we think about time passing, futurity, which is not about antagonistic synthesis. Embodying rather than overcoming contradiction.
- A delicate balance between overcoming and embodying. What does this mean? How do futures occur? What makes time progress? Historicity
- The future is a paradox: an imagination.
- Can we imagine a future which is not a projection? We need some sort of imagination.
- The future is anti-truth: it is a fabulation. We have to make things up. 
- We have to rely upon what we know to explain something which goes beyond us. 
- Imagination does not exist in a vacuum.
- Can imaginary worlds exist as a means for themselves?
- What counts as real? A reciprocal dependency. 
- How much is reality? What is the real?
- Narcissus: a rationalistic trope, you fall in love with what is represented? Look at the mirror, put it in a world. What's the world for the mirror.
- The power of the false: from Gilles Deleuze. Confounded ideas about what truth is.
- Two themes: imaginative worlds and fabulation
- The importance of fabulation: the act of inventing or relating false or fantastic tales
- truth as timeless, eternal, non-temporal, truth as faithful representation, as 'real'.
- Problems with formulation: trauma is too painful to represent; does not represent change, dynamic systems, what is unrepresented?
  - Trauma invades representation, that which we cannot understand, which we must wrestle with: the unrepresentable
  - This idea of truth only exists in non-temporal space; it doesn't work in temporal worlds.
  - The fantastic is often a reference to a change in scale.
  - No world happens on the same scale. 
  - Things which haunt us which we cannot see -- the spectre, the ghost in the machine
- Occult (that which is not seen but which is felt) and trickster wisdom (something nonlinear, nonlinear events; beyond projection of the now into the future)
- Journalists build truth through representational veracity.
- Tropes and ways to think about fantastical stories: what is the truth within them?
- In the act of world-building, the logics come out: we have to build the world to understand the trick.
- Imagination is not linear (projection -- linear algebra); it exceeds the characters, narratives, environments; it is immersive rather than causal (immersive is larger than causal: an environment for a subject, as opposed to a relationship between a subject and an object).
- Imagination points towards something much larger than what we get right now.
- Often we need to reconstitute the world in order to understand it. Not by answering a question, but by building a world.
- knowing through change instead of critique
- There is a kernel of fantasy at the very heart of our experience.
- The point of science fiction isn't predictive: it is to create a world under which certain predictions can or cannot come true.
- Can we recognize the imaginative in our daily lives and our most mundane arguments? That is the world.
- Philosophically: speculation
- Dorothy Napangardi, Sandhills in Minia mina
- Lines aren't just lines; worlds are nonlinear. 


## Week 2 Tuesday
- How does a picture make sense of the world?
- What is the function of mystery?
- Instability, incompleteness, movement.
- How do we think about rationality and order? Rationality as a supreme, universal way of thinking about how things are structured. 
- Worlds abide by homogenous epistemic systems. 
- Worldbuilding as a philosophical tool.
- Deleuze, _The Logic of Sense_
- Incompleteness which makes completeness
- We create uncertainty as we create knowledge. 
- The territory and the model: Borges. What is consistency, mystery? Can only get at mystery through the power of the false, precisely because it's not the territory.
- To what extent does the map make the territory.
- Is conspiracy theory giving body to mystery? Giving mystery a name?
- Mystery is fundamental. It comes from our being convinced that there is a consistency as opposed to our inconsistent experience.
- What purpose does the author serve as an intellectual vessel, and can authors simulate authors in other worlds who have unique intellectual production?
- Heterogeneity: people need to disagree, people need to conflict on how to inhabit the world.
- Metaphysical disagreement -- how do elements in the world itself interact?
- The magical item -- maybe our magic is more disturbing, not just concentrated in a particular item.
- Mystery should illuminate elements of our world.
- Why do we write? -- to understand, to change, to reflect, to uncover. 
- The role in speculating about the world: imaginative and speculative engagement.
- When you move from a subjectview to a worldview, the world emerges not just through the description of one subject, but through the engagement of multiple subjects. 
- Worlds get us out of our heads.
- Observer's dilemma
- Deeper engagement with the world than how to rationally depict the world.
- Do we discover or create worlds, or does it matter?The role of ritual
- Setting up the conditions for possibility
  - Are you provoking or provoked by?
  - Discovery: does it exist prior to its discovery?
- Anti-superhero movies
- *Promethea*
  - Words affect people directly -- not a postmodern semiotics
  - Turns the daughter into a story -- but how does the story function?
  - The eternal return: to rediscover that little bit of cosmology.
  - Difference within unity
  - Comic books are more of a duration than a moment.
  - The panel: the language of industrialization
  - How to recover richness from simple forms to give it depth and mystery?
- Plato's pharmacy

```
Prompt: Write a world which includes the stapler.

The bleak moon casts a dull light across the blackened street. Two bodies lay still: three pairs of thin and deep indents to the forehead, two on the back. In the distance, a curdling scream. Three equally spaced staples to the forehead, two across the back. The body slumps, quiet. The figure waits several moments, then reabsorbs the embedded staples. It opens the pockets and collects the contents: one gray device, seven faintly bloodied staples. Three are unused. and moves quietly away. It loads the stapler and presses it gently against its abdomen. The stapler faintly clicks. The staple clings into the delicate flesh. It holds the rotting material together. It gives the decaying body a new body: structure. Structure is life in a rotting world. Another staple to the arm, then to the chest, and four on the right leg. But not on the head. Never on the head.
```

## Week 2 Thursday
- Diagetic sound, involvement
- Deterroritorialization as a notion of abstraction, to a place of flow from one idea or another -- one space to another
- Dialectic - thesis, antithesis, synthesis.
- Marxism
  - Where does value come from? Labor, demand, social capital
  - Affective labor
  - False consciousness, truthhood comes through the proletariat
- Affective labor -- understanding the labor present in service, feeling, the exchange of signs
- Alienation of the self from the conditions of the labor
- In communication, production is not marked.
  - *Avatar* is produced, but it is the collective effort of many laborers.
  - Labor gets lost in a long chain of marking.
  - You've already destabilized the notion of production and the role of the individual
  - Sign-value and social value
- Complex systems destabilize the concept of labor, support fetishization. How to resist in the paradigm of production? Produce things which can take us somewhere else.
- Revolution -- dissemination, the revolution can(not) be televised
- The multitude -- Spinoza. 
- Mass culture: Horkheimer and Adorno -- enlightenment has two interesting components, a) makes technology, and b) makes critical thinking. Critical thinkers synthesize the cultural makers in a way to get us towards a more informed society.
  - We don't have the same form of culture production that we used to have.
  - Thurtle: desn't think that critical thinking is very important. What else do we need: we need imagination. 
  - Critical thinking is walking backwards: technoscience leads first (producer), and humanity follows (the intellectual)
  - Imagination allows us to negate this assymetric dialectic: the imagination leads. 
- The consumer: imaginative engagement and critique
- Authentic revolution -- coming from traditional Marxism, work from within the inside: because there is no outside to capital anymore.
- Empire: global media production
- Spinozan multitde: in a world which is globalized, multiplatformed -- includes all different forms of labor. Where is the individual? We no longer have a clear relationship between the individual and the mass?
- For Spinoza, Hardt & Negri, ... -- hold together mass production and individual production at the same moment.
- The crowd and the singularity.
- Deleuze & Guaratarri: line of flight, infinite deferral of synthesis -- not quite, thesis and antithesis in eternal production. 
- Authenticity ends up becoming the new topic in capital, authentcitiy has sign-value.
- What is the new authenticity? -- recognizing the relationship between our singularity and our multiplicity. And this leads us towards imagination.
- Liberatory politics as opposed to authenticity, truthhood
- We have multiplicity, a matrix of variations -- where we find a liberatory politics. 
- A Marxist will tell you that world-building is escapism, leading you away from understanding systems of production.
- This gives us a way of thinking about the possibilities for a better existence.
- What is a better existence? -- could be less oppressive, is it more creative
- Individualist liberalism: individuals are individuals, not only intellectually, but also politically or economically.
- When you are at the feet of the pyramid, your choice becomes inconsequential: it is no longer a right, it is no longer a choice.
  - Coke or Pepsi, it's another flavor of how we participate in society.
  - You're always already playing into a conception of society, society is already setting the rules
- Modernism/romanticist account of historicity: individuals drive history. Dialectical materialism: the material conditions of society (the 'outside') drive history. So what is the multitude's theory of history?
- A more subtle notion of how we are different, without thinking about what it means to be an individual -- both how can we be different and part of the crowd
- Where does the solution lie? In creating worlds which can alleviate suffering and increase creativity. We're not giving up politics: we're recognizing the complexity of politics.
- We will be building worlds which have to draw upon this world -- imagination never exists in a vaccuum. But which express a small difference.
- Biopolitics -- the ability to make live, and let die.
- Does world-building have anything to say about how we can merge the worlds that we imagine and the world in which we materially inhabit? Or can the premise of speculative knowledge only take us towards possibilities?
  - Write a manifesto and what you want to change (next week). When you world-build, you often end up getting ideas you wouldn't get. World-building is generative. It's about relationships, rather than objects: it's a way for speculating about different types of relationships. 
  - May not be predictive, in the sense of statistical modeling -- but it is a form of modeling to think about what can come about from different tyeps of relationships. 
- How does the multtide stand in relationship to intersectional epistemology?
- On the sex appeal of the inorganic
- We exist as historical subjects: now it is up to us to decide where we want to take it?
- Manifesto, initially: the principles to order the world around, and why
- The Futurist Manifesto: our society is not prepared for thinking about new developments in modernity, and we need an art which embraces it

### Week 3 Tuesday: Liquid Liberation
- Bare life vs political life: you only have rights if you are recognized as a political life.
- Biopolitics
- In biology: the individual is dead
- Giorgio Agamben
- Biopolitics -- comes out of Foucault, it's no longer about disciplining subjects, but about making subjects more lively. Doesn't fit into discourses on rights.
- What is the social function of wellness programs?
- Foucault's formulation -- the right to make live, and let die
- Necropolitics: there are active places where people are made to die
- Multitude -- what is the function of the historian? In *The Deep*
- Can utopia only happen without memory? What is the burden of memory?
- What is the importance of the false? One of the things we don't have in a state of perfection is time. Time is not about perfection, but circularity, decay. Aristotle -- history is a tragedy.
- The Middle Passage and haunting --  the role of the water in black American discourse. Water and trauma. Ends up becoming the middle stage which erases identity. The Middle Passage is a place of erasure.
- Freud's conception of the oceanic
- Water has important psychological associations.
- From the aqeous environment of the womb to the aqeous environment of the ocean. Ties together many of these themes, trauma: water as a place of rebirth, ritual. Water as part of the subconscious.
- *Civilization and its Disconentents* -- the mystic experience, the removal of the object//subject dyad. Oceanic as psychological: there is a state which is not fragmented in the way that 'civilized' minds are. This is the oceanic -- a retreat from trauma to go to the oceanic. Water gives oneself a chance to be reborn from traumatic experiences. 
- Defining of a new self -- the heart of world-building
- Rationality as a suspension of time.
- The history of biology is a history of trying to cut things up and explaining them. This depends upon the suspension of time. It is only recently that biology thinks about how things change.
- Books are channeling existing ideas -- the troubled concept of the author
- How does Marxism allow for the concept of a liberatory politics to emerge through popular culture?
- Afro-futurism, artistically exploring
- Drexciya
- There is a world which gives birth to world-building
- What is the role of myth in world-building? -- active and dynamic, whereas literature as frozen into a canon (Deleuze)
- Myth is active and reproductive
- Not quite "never forget", but "always relive" -- Nietzsche, eternal return
  - Repeat to live through 
- Storyview vs worldview
- A lot of people are into stories: but if you tell enough stories, you get a world
- How do objects come about?
- Worlds collide -- they intersect with our material bodies
- Psychoanalysis -- trauma to rebirth
- Don't separate the idealistic from the mateiral: you cannot. You cannot separate the story from the real. There is no box strong enough to pull the two apart. 
- Narrative -- as opposed to the world, the image. What is the role of enw stories in old worlds? We need new worlds. In world-building, we're not just interested in narratives, we're interested in what relationships come out of it and what narratives a world promotes.
- "oral hallucinations from the Middle Passage" 
- History vs hallucination: have others experienced it before?
- Can hallucinated experiences be real? Are hallucinations separate from reality? Reality is not just what we have around us: it's so much more. This is why our storyview is different from others' storyviews. 
- Scientific experiments as: "am I hallucinating?"
- Manifestos
  - Challenge and provoke
  - Come in many forms
  - Theatrical
  - Fiction dressed as fact
  - Embrace paradox
  - Always on the bleeding edge
  - Are almost magic
