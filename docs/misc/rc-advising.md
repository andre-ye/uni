## Personal Information and Communication

### FERPA
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act: A federal law that protects the privacy of student education records.

The University can disclose education records or Personally Identifiable Information when:
- written consent from the student is obtained,
- if the disclosure meets one of the statutory exemptions,
- or if the disclosure is directory information and the student has not placed a hold on the release of directory information.

### Directory Information
- Name, address, email, etc.
- You can refuse to release directory information.
- Go to the Office of the Registrar via MyUW and choose 'restrict access' to directory information.

### UW Email
- Check spam folders frequently.
- Don't miss important emails from administration, professors, TAs, or RC Staff.







## Preparing for Registration

### Placement Exams
- Check the appropriate website for updates.
- Placement Exams help determine which class level is appropriate.
- Proficiency Tests allow language requirements to be waived.

| Course Subject | Placement |
|  |  |
| Math | Take the guided [self-placement assessment](https://math.washington.edu/registration-information#registration-100-level){:target="_blank"} to determine if you should take MATH 111 (Algebra with Applications), MATH 120 (Precalculus), or MATH 124 (Calculus with Analytic Geometry). |
| World Language | If starting a new language, no exam is needed. If you are continuing to learn a language, take a placement test. If you are fluent in a non-English language, take a proficiency test. See [Humanities Academic Services](https://hasc.washington.edu/language-testing){:target="_blank"} for more information on language placement/proficiency exams. |
| Chemistry | Can take general chemistry (introductory) and honors chemistry (assumes mastery of elementary chemistry, uses calculus). Chemistry placement exam is required, free, and online for CHEM 110 (Preparation for General Chemistry), CHEM 120 (Principles of Chemistry), CHEM 142 (General Chemistry), and CHEM 143 (Accelerated General Chemistry). You can take the placement test two times. See [website](https://chem.washington.edu/placement){:target="_blank"} for details. |

### Credits
- You can earn credit by completing courses.
- Generally, 1 credit means 1 hour in class per week.
- Many UW courses are 5 credits (meet 5 hours per week).
- If you take 15 credits per quarter and attend three quarters per year, you will have completed 180 credits in four years.
- Most UW Bachelor's degrees require 180 credits.
- Between 12 to 18 credits costs the same for tuition.
- College assumes you spend at least double the class time outside of class.
  - e.g. a 5 credit course would need 10 hours of work out of class per week.
- Aim for 12-15 credits for the first quarter; you can take more later.
  - Aim for 45 credits by the end of Spring for the first year.

### Degree Pyramid

## Selecting Courses

### Using MyPlan
- MyPlan is an online tool to search for courses. `www.myplan.uw.edu`
- Search for courses
- Plan your academic path
- Find general educations
- Audit your degree
- Register for your courses

### Fall Quarter Courses
All RC first-year students must:
- enroll in FIG - first-year interest groups, small clumps of classes to support the transition into UW. You can add a class or classes.
- enroll in GEN ST 297 A3 (Undergraduate Seminar). Small-group discussion with faculty representing a wide spectrum of academic disciplines. RC first-year seminar (1 credit, C/NC). Focus on support, connection, and faculty guest lectures.
**FIGs open June 28th**.

### Other Classes to Consider

| Class | Credits | Title/Description |
|  |  |
| EDUC 215: College Resilience (FIG) | 5 | Section B: Th 2:30-5:20 PM. Learning skills and resilience in college and personal life. |

### Math Pathways
A self-assessment is recommended for entry into any math introduction series/class.

Math Introductory Pathways:

| Course | Title |
|  |  |
| MATH 111 | Algebra with applications (business/econ/psych) |
| MATH 120 | Precalculus |
| MATH 124 | Calculus with Analytic Geometry |
| MATH 134 | Accelerated [Honors] Calculus |
| Q SCI 190 | Quantitative Analysis for Environmental Science |
| Q SCI 291 | Analysis for Biologists

Advice from ACADs/EEPers
- Math in college is harder than in high school.
- Be wise - don't assume classes are easy. Talk to ACADs/EEPers.
- Try the honors math sequence.
- It's better to review some things than take a class you're unprepared for.
- Take MATH 124 unless you have a very solid background in mathematics.
- Be prepared to study no matter what, and attend lectures.

### Science Pathway

Chemistry Introductory Pathways:

| Course | Title | Description |
| CHEM 110 | Prep for General Chemistry | For those without any chemistry background; an introduction. |
| CHEM 120 | Intro to General Chemistry | More specific focus, like MATH 111. What are majors you are considering and is CHEM 120 an option? |
| CHEM 142 | General Chemistry | Can be taken after CHEM 110. Beginning of general series. |
| CHEM 143 | Accelerated General Chemistry | Have a bit of general knowledge in general chemistry, want to go through the introduction series a little bit faster. |
| CHEM 145 | Honors General Chemistry | Comparable to MATH 134 in rigor. |

Advice from ACAD/EEPERs
- If you don't have any HS CHemistry background, taking 142 would be a bit of a challenge.
- If premed, take 142 unless you've taken AP/IB.
- MATH 125 and CHEM 142 together are tough, though manageable. Be warned that these are known as "weedout" classes.

What about biology and physics?
- Most students begin with math and chemistry.
- BIO 200 requires CHEM 152.
- PHYS 121 requires MATH 124.

### Planning for Technology Majors
Check prerequisites for CS, INFO, ACMS, ENGR, PRE-HEALTH.

- Computer Science: students interested in software systems and application design. Suitable for double majoring.
- Computing Engineering: students interested in building systems, including hardware and software components.
- Students working towards either degree have the same broad opportunities that the Allen School offers.

ENGR Requirement for the Fall
- ENGR 101: *Engineering Exploration*. Required for all ENGR students.

Allen School Admissions
- Students take prerequisites in their first year and apply to these majors in the summer after their first year.

Info from RC Letter
- Most UW majors are capacity constrained; admission to UW does not guarantee admission.
- Enrollment at UW means preparation for the possibility of pursuing a non-CS or engineering major.
- RC staff will work to support students.
- See [RC Information on CSE Entry](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KlndDK77ESDfbhR8PdKSV_FZ5qfM1S9G/view){:target="_blank"}.

[Majors and Minors](https://www.washington.edu/uaa/advising/degree-overview/majors/double-degree-and-double-major/){:target="_blank"}
- Double majors
- Double degrees
- Minors

**Take a balanced schedule.**
