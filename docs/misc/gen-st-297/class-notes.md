## Professor Li, Chemistry

- Quantum computing - what does chemistry have to do with it?
- Adjunct position in material science, but bread and butter is CS tools to study chemical phenomena.
- Develop algorithms to simulate chmemical properties - dance of electrons to represent quantum entanglement.

### What do Electrons Look Like in Molecules?
- Electron Structure Theory - from atom to molecule.
- Electrons can take on many different shapes - the nucleus can take on different shapes as well.
- A quantum particle - no longer dots in space.
- We cannot develop quantum information from the notion of two dots in space.
- In the quantum world, these have wave functions that extend far away from the center.
- Two spheres have wave functions in which the tails can 'talk' or 'communicate' to one another.
- Quantum entanglement - commmunication, dots are no longer dots but clouds.
- You can mathematically prove this from the wave function.
- However, it is very difficult to observe entanglement unless we create much larger waves.
- Foundations of quantum computing and entanglement.
- If we have two electrons that can talk to one another in a molecule, they can form a more extended network - short-distance entanglement, molecular orbitals.

### Electron Dynamics and Spectroscopy
- Fields can facilitate electron communication within a molecule.
- In the quantum world, electrons even very far from one another can communicate via electromagnetic fields.
- Quantum mechanics is a series of hypotheses.
- You always have nonzero probabilities that two electrons can communicate with one another.
- Qubit nuclear entanglement.

### Time-Dependent Quantum Theory for Modeling Electron Dynamics in Molecules
- Perform Fourier transformation on entanglement.
- Everything in the end is mathematics - while quantum mechanics is not derived from mathematics, we can use mathematics to understand quantum mehcnaics.

### Computational Chemistry
- Fortran, C++, Python, etc.
- Can use code to simulate quantum mechanical behavior.
- Use computing facilities to understand entanglement of many bodies.
- We can understand material properties; if we know an electronic system can behave in a certain way, we can design new molecules and materials.

## Professor Million, American Indian Studies

- Fighting for the presence of an Indian Studies Department in many places, including on the University of Washington.
- Many people don't know who American Indian peoples are.
- Indian was a word brought by Europeans, designated "Indians".
- There is a real history to designations - it is a political history that goes into it.
- 500 federally recognized Native nations in the United States.
- In the United States, Native states have the same powers as the state of Washington; the state must negotiate with Native peoples.
- Federal recognition and tribes in Washington
- AI department turned 50 last year!
- Interdisciplinary study.
- Residential Schools - removing culture in a brutal fashion.

> "There is no history that has not been fought into truth."

- Every generation argues the truth all over again.
- AIS 170 - Art and Aesthetics

## Research and Internships

### Undergraduate Research
- A creative and systematic process of discovering new knowledge.
- UW is a research institution.
- Take persistence and applying to research.
- Many aspects of the research process can be performed remotely.

### Finding Internships
- Career and internship center.
- Internship - way to integrate academic learning with hands-on experience.
- Develop or refine skills
- Explore sectors, careers, and environments.
- Pay, credit, none, or both.
- Typically lasts at least 1 quarter - year-round or summer.
- Internships are different.
- Internship - intentional focus on student learning.
- Have a defined beginning and end.
- Often center around defined projects.
